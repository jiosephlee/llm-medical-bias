This manual covers all details of the Emergency_ Severity Index (ESI)‚Äîa five-level emergency department triage algorithm that provides clinically relevant stratification of patients into five groups from 1 (most urgent) to 5 (least urgent) on the basis of acuity and resource needs.\\n\\nAfter emergency physicians Richard Wuerz and David Eitel developed the ESI in 1998 and pilot testing yielded favorable results, the ESI Triage Group was formed. Further work on the initial development of ESI was carried out under an AHRQ grant. The ESI Triage Group, which consisted of medical clinicians, managers, educators, and researchers, further refined the algorithm to what it is today.\\n\\nIn keeping with our mission to improve the quality, safety, efficiency, and effectiveness of health care for all Americans, one of AHRQ's areas of emphasis is training. Along with the accompanying set of two DVDs, this handbook will provide invaluable assistance to emergency department nurses, physicians, and administrators in the implementation of a comprehensive ESI educational program. These materials are based on ESI Version 4, which updates the algorithm with a particular emphasis on the expansion of ESI level 1 criteria and refinement of the pediatric fever criteria.\\n\\nA well-implemented ESI program will help hospital emergency departments rapidly identify patients in need of immediate attention, better identify patients who could safely and more efficiently be seen in a fast-track or urgent care center rather than the main ED, and more accurately determine thresholds for diversion of ambulance patients from the ED.\\n\\nWe hope that you find this tool useful in your ongoing efforts to improve the quality of care provided by your emergency department.\\n\\n### Chapter 2.Triage Acuity Systems\\n\\n##### Standardization of Triage Acuity\\n\\nAlthough there are more than 110 million visits to U.S. emergency departments (EDs) each year (McCaig & Burt, 2004) there are very little aggregate data about those visits on the local, regional or national level. It is difficult to answer important questions such as ‚ÄúWhich EDs see the sickest patients?‚Äù and ‚ÄúHow does patient acuity affect ED overcrowding?‚Äù There is growing interest in the establishment of standards for ED data in the United States to support clinical care, ED surveillance, benchmarking, and research activities (Barthell, Coonan, Finnell, Pollock, & Cochrane, 2004; Gilboy, Travers & Wuerz, 1999; Handler et al., 2004; National Center for Injury Prevention and Control\\n\\n[NCIPC], 1997; Zimmermann, 2001). One important ED data element is triage acuity, which has been defined by the Data Elements for Emergency Department Systems Task Force as: ‚ÄúClassification of patient acuity that characterizes the degree to which the patient's condition is life- or limb-threatening, and whether immediate treatment is needed to alleviate symptoms‚Äù (NCIPC, 1997, p. 94).\\n\\nUnfortunately, there is great variability in ED triage acuity systems, particularly in the United States (Emergency Nurses Association [ENA], 1997). The various systems describe triage categories using different labels, and the definitions for each level are not universally agreed upon. Examples of acuity rating systems are listed in Table 2-1. Given the lack of standardization of triage acuity data in the U.S., it is not surprising that the ED has been described as a ‚Äúblack box‚Äù of vital public health information that is largely inaccessible in present forms (Martinez, 1995).\\n\\nThe Emergency Severity Index (ESI) is a promising new tool for triage acuity assessment in the ED. It has been shown to be reproducible across EDs, \\nincluding urban and rural settings and academic and community hospitals (Eitel, Travers, Rosenau, Gilboy & Wuerz, 2003). If implemented widely in U.S. EDs, the ESI has the potential to become a standard for triage acuity assessment. In this chapter, we describe the types of triage systems traditionally used in EDs in the United States, and then present a review of the research on those systems. Next, a brief description of recent triage methods that have been developed in Australia, Canada and the United Kingdom is presented. The chapter concludes with a review of the research on the new ESI triage system and discusses the potential benefits of the ESI.\\n\\n##### Triage Systems in the United States\\n\\nThough many U.S. hospitals still use a three- or fourlevel triage system, the trend is toward the use of five-level systems. The National Center for Health Statistics plans to replace four-level triage data with five-level triage data in future national benchmarking surveys of U.S. EDs.\"}"
