This manual covers all details of the Emergency_ Severity Index (ESI)—a five-level emergency department triage algorithm that provides clinically relevant stratification of patients into five groups from 1 (most urgent) to 5 (least urgent) on the basis of acuity and resource needs.\\n\\nAfter emergency physicians Richard Wuerz and David Eitel developed the ESI in 1998 and pilot testing yielded favorable results, the ESI Triage Group was formed. Further work on the initial development of ESI was carried out under an AHRQ grant. The ESI Triage Group, which consisted of medical clinicians, managers, educators, and researchers, further refined the algorithm to what it is today.\\n\\nIn keeping with our mission to improve the quality, safety, efficiency, and effectiveness of health care for all Americans, one of AHRQ's areas of emphasis is training. Along with the accompanying set of two DVDs, this handbook will provide invaluable assistance to emergency department nurses, physicians, and administrators in the implementation of a comprehensive ESI educational program. These materials are based on ESI Version 4, which updates the algorithm with a particular emphasis on the expansion of ESI level 1 criteria and refinement of the pediatric fever criteria.\\n\\nA well-implemented ESI program will help hospital emergency departments rapidly identify patients in need of immediate attention, better identify patients who could safely and more efficiently be seen in a fast-track or urgent care center rather than the main ED, and more accurately determine thresholds for diversion of ambulance patients from the ED.\\n\\nWe hope that you find this tool useful in your ongoing efforts to improve the quality of care provided by your emergency department.\\n\\n### Chapter 2.Triage Acuity Systems\\n\\n##### Standardization of Triage Acuity\\n\\nAlthough there are more than 110 million visits to U.S. emergency departments (EDs) each year (McCaig & Burt, 2004) there are very little aggregate data about those visits on the local, regional or national level. It is difficult to answer important questions such as “Which EDs see the sickest patients?” and “How does patient acuity affect ED overcrowding?” There is growing interest in the establishment of standards for ED data in the United States to support clinical care, ED surveillance, benchmarking, and research activities (Barthell, Coonan, Finnell, Pollock, & Cochrane, 2004; Gilboy, Travers & Wuerz, 1999; Handler et al., 2004; National Center for Injury Prevention and Control\\n\\n[NCIPC], 1997; Zimmermann, 2001). One important ED data element is triage acuity, which has been defined by the Data Elements for Emergency Department Systems Task Force as: “Classification of patient acuity that characterizes the degree to which the patient's condition is life- or limb-threatening, and whether immediate treatment is needed to alleviate symptoms” (NCIPC, 1997, p. 94).\\n\\nUnfortunately, there is great variability in ED triage acuity systems, particularly in the United States (Emergency Nurses Association [ENA], 1997). The various systems describe triage categories using different labels, and the definitions for each level are not universally agreed upon. Examples of acuity rating systems are listed in Table 2-1. Given the lack of standardization of triage acuity data in the U.S., it is not surprising that the ED has been described as a “black box” of vital public health information that is largely inaccessible in present forms (Martinez, 1995).\\n\\nThe Emergency Severity Index (ESI) is a promising new tool for triage acuity assessment in the ED. It has been shown to be reproducible across EDs, \\nincluding urban and rural settings and academic and community hospitals (Eitel, Travers, Rosenau, Gilboy & Wuerz, 2003). If implemented widely in U.S. EDs, the ESI has the potential to become a standard for triage acuity assessment. In this chapter, we describe the types of triage systems traditionally used in EDs in the United States, and then present a review of the research on those systems. Next, a brief description of recent triage methods that have been developed in Australia, Canada and the United Kingdom is presented. The chapter concludes with a review of the research on the new ESI triage system and discusses the potential benefits of the ESI.\\n\\n##### Triage Systems in the United States\\n\\nThough many U.S. hospitals still use a three- or fourlevel triage system, the trend is toward the use of five-level systems. The National Center for Health Statistics plans to replace four-level triage data with five-level triage data in future national benchmarking surveys of U.S. EDs. This decision was based upon the growing evidence that five-level triage acuity data are more reliable and valid than three-level systems (personal communication, Linda McCaig, National Center for Health Statistics, October 6, 2004).\\n\\nBoth ENA and the American College of Emergency Physicians (ACEP) have come out in support of fivelevel triage systems for U.S. EDs. A joint ENA-ACEP task force was convened in 2003 to study the evidence on five-level triage systems. The task force's work is ongoing at present. The ACEP and ENA issued the following joint statement in 2003:\\n\\n_ACEP and ENA believe that quality of patient_ _care would benefit from implementing a_ _standardized emergency department (ED) triage_ _scale and acuity categorization process. Based on_ _expert consensus of currently available evidence,_ _ACEP and ENA support the adoption of a_ _reliable, valid five-level triage scale (ACEP,_ _2003; ENA, 2003)._\\n\\nIn a paper published by the task force in 2005, both the ESI and Canadian Triage and Acuity Scale (CTAS) were recommended as valid and reliable triage systems. (Fernandes et al., 2005) In light of the growing evidence supporting five-level triage systems, it is likely that more U.S. hospitals are now using some form of five-level triage. The ENA plans to collect data about U.S. hospitals' use of the various triage systems in their upcoming ED survey.\\n\\n##### Research on Triage Systems in the United States\\n\\nThere is a growing body of research on triage acuity systems. The research has focused on two key features of acuity ratings by triage nurses: reliability and validity (Pedhazur & Schmelkin, 1991; Waltz, Strickland & Lenz, 1991). Reliability is the consistency, or agreement, among those using a rating system. There are two types of reliability that pertain to ED triage acuity ratings. First, interrater reliability is a measure of reproducibility: Will two different nurses rate the same patient with the same triage acuity level? Intrarater reliability is an indication of whether the same nurse, over time, will rate the same patient with the same acuity level. Several studies in the United States have demonstrated poor inter- and intrarater reliability of conventional three-level triage systems (Gill, Reese & Diamond, 1996; Travers, Waller, Bowling, Flowers & Tintinalli, 2002; Wuerz, Fernandes & Alarcon, 1998). In one study, 305 triage ratings were reviewed after all triage nurses attended a mandatory refresher course on the hospital's three-level triage scale (Travers et al., 2002). The original triage nurses' ratings were compared with retrospective ratings assigned by an expert panel of ED triage nurses, and there was agreement in approximately half of the cases.\\n\\nValidity is the accuracy of the rating system, and assesses how well the system measures what it is intended to measure. The validity of acuity ratings is an indication of whether or not the rating, for example, of “nonurgent” is an accurate assessment of the lack of urgency of an ED patient's problem. Validity has proven difficult to assess for triage acuity, and has not been reported in research studies\\n\\non conventional three-level triage in the United States. Unlike the urine culture, which is the gold standard for the correct clinical diagnosis of a urinary tract infection, there is no clear gold standard against which the validity of triage acuity ratings can be measured. However, proxy measures that have been used to evaluate five-level systems include admission rates, resource utilization and 6month mortality.\\n\\n##### Triage Acuity Research on Five- Level Systems Abroad\\n\\nThere are well-validated and reliable five-level triage systems that have become the standard in other countries. Three of those systems are described in Table 2-2.\\n\\nThe Australasian Triage Scale (ATS), a system developed in Australia, has been used throughout Australia and New Zealand since the early 1990s (Australasian College for Emergency Medicine, 1994, 2002; Cameron, Bradt & Ashby, 1996). The Australian Council on Healthcare Standards has adopted the ATS as a basis of ED assessment and quality of care, and triage ratings are subject to regular review. Australian EDs are expected to treat patients according to standards based on the triage category. For example, an emergency patient must be seen within 10 minutes, whereas a nonurgent patient must be seen within 2 hours.\\n\\nValidity and reliability of the ATS have been evaluated in several studies. In the absence of a true gold standard for triage acuity assessment, researchers have compared the five-level scale to other severity of illness scales and outcomes (Cameron et al., 1996; Cleary, Ashby, Jelinek & Lagaida, 1994, Erwich, Bond, Phillips, & Baggoley, 1997). Triage levels correlated highly with disease and population-specific scales including the Injury Severity Scales, trauma score, and cardiac, asthma and pediatric scales. The ATS has been shown to correlate strongly with resource consumption and outcome data, such as admission rates, ED length of stay and mortality rates. Research has also shown that the ATS has a fair to moderate degree of interrater reliability in studies in which triage nurses were asked to rate the acuity of patients described in case study format (Dilley & Standen, 1998, Jelinek & Little, 1996).\\n\\nFive-level triage systems have also been implemented in the United Kingdom (U.K.) and Canada. The Manchester Triage Scale is used in the\\n\\nU.K., and utilizes a presentational flow-chart based format (Manchester Triage Group, 1997). Nurses first identify the patient's chief complaint, and then choose one of 52 flow charts to conduct a structured interview and then assign a triage level from 1 (immediate care needed) to 5 (care within 4 hours). The system has been endorsed by the Accident and Emergency Nurses Association (Zimmermann, 2001). There is limited research on the Manchester system. In one study of reliability, triage nurse ratings were compared retrospectively to senior medical staff ratings; agreement was only fair to moderate (Goodacre, Gillett, Harris & Houlihan, 1999).\\n\\nThe Canadian Triage and Acuity Scale (CTAS) was developed by a group of Canadian emergency physicians. (Beveridge & Ducharme, 1997; Canadian Association for Emergency Physicians [CAEP], 2002). The National Emergency Nurses' Affiliation, Inc. (NENA) and the Canadian Association for Emergency Physicians (CAEP) have endorsed the CTAS as the national standard for ED triage. Canadian hospitals are required to submit data to the Canadian government, including CTAS ratings, on all ED visits. The Canadian five-level scale has also been shown to have good interrater reliability in studies in which clinicians rated the acuity of written scenarios taken from actual patient cases\\n\\n##### History of the Emergency Severity Index (ESI)\\n\\nThe Emergency Severity Index (ESI) is a five-level triage scale developed by ED physicians Richard Wuerz and David Eitel in the United States (Gilboy et al., 1999; Wuerz, Milne, Eitel, Travers & Gilboy, 2000). The two originators believed that a principal role for an emergency department triage instrument is to facilitate the prioritization of patients based on the urgency of the patients' conditions. The triage nurse determines priority by posing the question, “Who should be seen first?” Drs. Wuerz and Eitel realized, however, that when more than one top priority patient is present simultaneously, the operating question becomes, “How long can everybody wait?” The ESI was developed around a new conceptual model of ED triage. In addition to asking which patient should be seen first, triage nurses use the ESI to also consider what resources are necessary to get the patient through to an ED disposition. The ESI retains the traditional foundation of patient urgency, and then seeks to accomplish a second goal, not just patient sorting but also patient streaming: Getting the right patient to the right resources at the right place and at the right time.\\n\\nVersion 1 (v. 1) of the ESI was originally implemented at two university-based EDs in the spring of 1999. By the fall of 2000, the ESI was revised with input from ED clinicians to include pediatric patient triage criteria, and then version 2 (v. 2) was implemented in five additional hospitals (including non-university teaching and community settings). Based on feedback from nurses and physicians using the ESI at these sites, along with the best available scientific evidence, the ESI was further refined as version 3 (v. 3) in 2001 (Wuerz et al., 2001). Recent work has led to additional revisions to the tool, which is introduced in this edition of the ESI handbook as version 4 (v. 4) (Tanabe et al., in press).\\n\\nEmergency physicians and nurses in the United States and Canada have conducted several research studies in which the reliability and validity of the ESI has been assessed. The ESI has been directly compared to conventional three-level triage and to the five-level CTAS. These studies will be described later in the chapter. Like the Australasian, Canadian and U.K. scales, ESI triage has five levels. However, it is different in both its conceptual approach and practical application. The underlying assumption of the triage scales from Australia, Canada and the U.K. is that the purpose of triage is to determine how long the patient can wait for care in the ED. Clear definitions of time to physician evaluation are an integral part of both algorithms. This represents a major difference between ESI and CTAS and the ATS. ESI does not define expected time intervals to physician evaluation.\\n\\nThe ESI is unique in that it also requires the triage nurse to anticipate expected resource needs (e.g., diagnostic tests and procedures), in addition to acuity, to determine a triage category for less acute patients. The ESI triage levels are outlined in Figure 2-1. The process of categorizing ED patients using the ESI will be described in detail in subsequent chapters. Briefly, acuity judgments are addressed first based on the stability of the patient's vital functions and the likelihood of an immediate life or organ threat. Then expected resource needs are addressed for stable patients based on the experienced triage nurse's prediction of the resources needed to get the patient to an emergency department disposition. Resource needs can range from none to two or more.\\n\\n##### Research on the Emergency Severity Index\\n\\nIn a pilot study of ESI v.1 ratings for 493 triage encounters at two Boston hospitals in 1998, researchers found that the system was both valid and reliable (Wuerz et al., 2000). The patients were triaged simultaneously by the triage nurse using the traditional three-level scale and by the research nurse who used the initial version of the ESI. Then, an investigator triaged the patients again using the ESI. The investigator was blinded to the research nurses' ESI rating, and used only the written triage note to make the triage decision. Triage levels were strongly associated with resources used in the ED and with outcomes such as hospitalization. Higher acuity patients (ESI levels 1 and 2) consumed more resources and were more likely to be admitted to the hospital than low resource patients (ESI levels 4 and 5). Interrater reliability between the research nurse and the investigator was found to be good, with 77 percent exact agreements and 22 percent within one triage level.\\n\\nThe reliability of the ESI has been evaluated in several studies, using the kappa statistic to measure inter-rater reliability. Kappas can range from 0 (no agreement) to 1 (perfect agreement). At one of the two original ESI sites, a time series design was used to compare the reliability of triage ratings using a three-level scale, then ESI v.1 was implemented and triage ratings were re-examined (Travers et al., 2002). Reliability improved from a weighted kappa of 0.53 for the three-level system to 0.68 for the five-level ESI. In another study, researchers examined the reliability and validity of ESI v.2 during and after implementation of the system into triage practice at seven hospitals in the northeast and southeast. During the ESI triage education program, more than 200 triage nurses at the seven sites were asked to rate 40 case studies using the ESI (Eitel et al., 2003). The study results indicated substantial interrater reliability with kappas ranging from 0.70 to 0.80. Three hundred eighty-six triage decisions on actual patients were also evaluated and found to have high interrater reliability, with weighted kappas ranging from 0.69 to 0.87. In another study at a Midwestern, urban ED, researchers evaluated the reliability of the ESI v.3 for 403 actual patient triages and found a kappa of 0.89 (Tanabe, Gimbel, Yarnold, Kyriacou & Adams, 2004).\\n\\nCanadian and American researchers have also directly compared the inter-rater reliability of the ESI and the CTAS in a randomized trial (Worster et al., 2004). They studied the triage assignments of ten Canadian triage nurses experienced with CTAS. The nurses were randomly assigned to initial ESI v.3 or CTAS refresher training, and then rated 200 case studies with the ESI or CTAS, respectively. Both groups had excellent inter-rater reliability, with kappas of 0.89 (ESI) and 0.91 (CTAS).\\n\\nThe validity of the ESI has been evaluated by examination of outcomes for several thousand patients. The studies found consistent, strong correlations of the ESI with hospitalization, ED length of stay, and mortality (Eitel et al., 2003; Tanabe, et al., 2004; Wuerz, 2001; Wuerz et al., 2001). The ESI has also been found to have moderate correlations with physician evaluation and management codes and nursing workload measures (Travers et al., 2002). The ESI has been shown to facilitate meaningful comparisons of case mix between hospitals. A stratified random sample of 200 patients was selected from each of the seven initial ESI hospitals, and case mix was compared (Eitel et al., 2003). As expected, there was a higher percentage of high acuity patients at the tertiary care centers, compared with a higher percentage of low resource patients at the community hospitals.\\n\\nIn a survey of nursing staff at the two original university teaching hospitals, responses to the implementation of the ESI were positive (Wuerz et al., 2001). The nurses reported that the ESI was easier to use and more useful in prioritizing patients for treatment than the former three-level systems in use at the two sites.\\n\\nIn the most recent study of the ESI, the validity of ESI level 2 was examined in detail (Tanabe et al., in press). In an evaluation of outcomes for 571 ESI level-2 patients at five hospitals, it was found that 20 percent of level-2 patients received immediate, life-saving interventions. The authors concluded that such patients would benefit from being classified as ESI level 1. The updated ESI v. 4 presented in later chapters of this book reflects the revisions made to the ESI based upon this recent study.\\n\\n##### Benefits of the Emergency Severity Index\\n\\nTo date, the ESI has been implemented by hospitals in different regions of the country, by university and community hospitals, and by teaching and nonteaching sites. The ED clinicians, managers and researchers at those sites have identified several benefits of ESI triage over conventional three-level scales. One benefit of the ESI is the rapid identification of patients that need immediate attention. The focus of ESI triage is on quick sorting of patients in the setting of constrained resources. In part, ESI triage returns to the fundamental purpose of triage as it was originally defined in the days of Napoleon's army. ESI triage is a rapid sorting into five groups with clinically meaningful differences in projected resource needs and therefore, associated operational needs. Use of the ESI for this rapid sorting can lead to improved flow of patients through the ED. Once an ESI triage level is assigned, the patient can be directed to a more complete assessment, registration, initial treatment, or waiting based on their acuity and their presumed resource needs. For example, level-1 and 2 patients can be taken directly to the treatment area for rapid evaluation and treatment, while level-4 and 5 patients can go to registration and then be sent to the waiting room to await an available bed.\\n\\nAn important issue that is independent of ESI triage is the timing of the complete nursing assessment. Many believe that a complete assessment need not be done at the initial triage station, but rather can occur in the main treatment area or secondary triage area as appropriate to the needs of each patient and the current activity level of the ED (Gilboy et al., 1999). Only the assessment necessary to make an ESI assignment is required at triage in order to facilitate the initial sorting of patients. Comprehensive clinical assessments take significant time to complete and, when done at triage, can delay care and reduce satisfaction for patients with more minor emergencies. With increasing patient volumes and complexity contributing to ED overcrowding, it is time to reconsider conventional processes of care to increase efficiency and effectiveness. However, it is always important to gain sufficient information to be able to determine the correct triage category. This is especially true when waits are long to see the physician, as is frequently the case with increased volumes. Triage has become even more crucial with extended waiting room times. Assignment of an inappropriate low triage category can increase the risk of a bad outcome due to the associated long wait.\\n\\nOther benefits of the ESI include discrimination of patients who do not need to be seen in the main ED, but could safely and more efficiently be seen in a fast-track or urgent care center. For example, in many hospitals, the triage policy stipulates that all ESI level 4 and 5 patients can be sent to either the medical urgent care or minor trauma areas of the ED. The triage policy also allows for some level-3 patients to be sent to urgent care (UC), such as patients needing simple migraine headache treatment. ESI level-3 patients triaged to UC and all patients sent to the acute area from UC for more serious conditions are monitored in the quality improvement program. Nurses using the ESI have reported that the tool facilitates communication of patient acuity more effectively than the former three-level triage scales used at the sites (Wuerz et al., 2001). For example, the triage nurse can tell the charge nurse, “I need a bed for a level 2 patient,” and through this common language, the charge nurse understands what is needed without a detailed explanation of the patient by the triage nurse.\\n\\nThe ESI has also been used as the foundation for ED policies that address specific populations. For example, the psychiatric service at one site is expected to provide consults for level 2 and 3 patients within 30 minutes and for level 4 and 5 patients within one hour of notification. At another site, the ESI has been incorporated into a policy for patients greater than 20-weeks pregnant who present to the ED. Patients rated at ESI levels 1 and 2 are treated in the ED by emergency medicine with an obstetrical consult. Those rated 3, 4, or 5 are triaged to the labor and delivery area of the hospital.\\n\\nThe ESI is also a useful tool for determination of thresholds for diversion of ambulance patients from the ED. The ED Diversion Policy and Guidelines at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston defines maximum capacity as 100 percent of RN-staffed ED beds occupied. ESI is used to determine overcapacity.\\n\\nResearch has shown that the ESI is a reliable, valid tool for rating triage acuity. The system has been adopted by a variety of EDs in different regions of the United States and in both academic and community settings. The participating hospitals have demonstrated the value of the ESI for improved ED operations and patient care. Wider adoption of the ESI by U.S. hospitals could lead to the establishment of a standard for triage acuity assessment, which will facilitate benchmarking, public health surveillance and research.\\n\\n### Chapter 3. Introduction to the Emergency Severity Index\\n\\nThe Emergency Severity Index (ESI) is a simple to use, five-level triage instrument that categorizes emergency department patients by evaluating both patient acuity and resources. Initially the triage nurse assesses only acuity level. If a patient does not meet high acuity level criteria (ESI level 1 or 2), the triage nurse then evaluates expected resource needs to help determine a triage level (ESI level 3, 4, or 5). Inclusion of resource needs in the triage rating is a unique feature of the ESI in comparison with other triage systems. Acuity is determined by the stability of vital functions and potential for life, limb, or organ threat. The triage nurse estimates resource needs based on previous experience with patients presenting with similar injuries or complaints. Resource needs are defined as the number of resources a patient is expected to consume in order for a disposition decision to be reached. Once appropriately oriented to the algorithm, the triage nurse will be able to rapidly and accurately triage patients into one of five explicitly defined and mutually exclusive levels. The ESI provides emergency departments with a valid, reliable triage system (Eitel, Travers, Rosenau, Gilboy & Wuerz, 2003; Travers, Waller, Bowling, Flowers & Tintinalli, 2002; Wuerz, Travers, Gilboy, Eitel, Rosenau & Yazhari, 2001; Tanabe, Gimbel, Yarnold, Kyriacou, & Adams, 2004; Tanabe, Gimbel, Yarnold, & Adams, 2004).\\n\\nIn this chapter, we present a step-by-step description of how to triage with the ESI algorithm. Subsequent chapters explain key concepts in more detail and provide numerous examples to clarify the finer points of ESI application.\\n\\nAlgorithms are frequently used in emergency care. Most emergency clinicians are familiar with the algorithms used in courses such as Basic Life Support, Advanced Cardiac Life Support, and the Trauma Nursing Core Course. These courses present a step-by-step approach to clinical decision making that the clinician is able to internalize with practice. Each step of the algorithm tells the user what questions to ask or what information to gather. Based on the data or answers obtained, a decision is made and the algorithm directs the user to the next step, and ultimately to an outcome.\\n\\nTriage with the ESI algorithm requires the experienced ED nurse to start at the top of the algorithm. A conceptual overview of the ESI algorithm is presented in Figure 3-1 to illustrate the major ESI decision points. The actual ESI algorithm is described in detail later in this chapter (Figure 3-1a). The algorithm uses four decision points (A, B, C, and D) to sort patients into one of the five triage levels (Figure 3-1). With practice, the triage nurse will be able to rapidly move from one ESI decision point to the next.\\n\\n##### Decision Point A: Is the Patient Dying?\\n\\nSimply stated, at decision point A (Figure 3-2) the triage nurse asks if this patient is dying. If the answer is “yes,” the triage process is complete and the patient is automatically triaged as ESI level 1. A “no” answer moves the user to the next step in the algorithm, decision point B.\\n\\nThe following question is used to determine whether the patient is dying (conceptual algorithm): Does the patient require immediate life-saving intervention? The following questions are helpful in determining whether the patient meets level-1 criteria:\\n\\n- Does the patient require an immediate airway, medication, or other hemodynamic intervention?\\n\\n- Does the patient meet any of the following criteria: already intubated, apneic, pulseless, severe respiratory distress, SpO2 < 90 percent, acute mental status changes, or unresponsive?\\n\\nResearch has demonstrated that the triage nurse is able to accurately predict the need for immediate interventions (Tanabe et al., in press). Table 3-1 lists interventions that are considered life saving and those that are not, for the purposes of ESI triage.\\n\\nInterventions not considered life saving include some interventions that are diagnostic or therapeutic, but none that would “save a life.” Lifesaving interventions are aimed at securing an airway, maintaining breathing, or supporting circulation. Listed below are additional questions that may be helpful in determining whether the patient requires a life-saving intervention.\\n\\n- Does this patient have a patent airway?\\n\\n- Is the patient breathing?\\n\\n- Does the patient have a pulse?\\n\\n- Is the nurse concerned about the pulse rate, rhythm, and quality?\\n\\n- Was this patient intubated pre-hospital because of concerns about the patient's ability to maintain a patent airway, spontaneously breathe, or maintain oxygen saturation?\\n\\n- Is the nurse concerned about this patient's ability to deliver adequate oxygen to the tissues?\\n\\nThe ESI level-1 patient always presents to the emergency department with an unstable condition. Because the patient could die without immediate care a team response is initiated; the physician is at the bedside, and nursing is providing intensive care. ESI level-1 patients are seen immediately because timeliness of interventions can affect morbidity and mortality.\\n\\nImmediate physician involvement in the care of the patient is a key difference between ESI level-1 and 2 patients. Level-1 patients are critically ill and require immediate physician evaluation and interventions. Conversely, while level-2 patients are also very ill, the emergency nurse can initiate care through protocols without a physician at the bedside. The nurse recognizes that the patient needs interventions but is confident that the patient's clinical condition will not deteriorate. The emergency nurse can initiate intravenous access, administer supplemental oxygen, obtain an ECG, and place the patient on a cardiac monitor, all before a physician presence is needed.\\n\\nWhen considering the need for immediate lifesaving interventions, the triage nurse also carefully evaluates the patients' respiratory status and oxygen saturation (SpO2). A patient in severe respiratory distress or with an SpO2 < 90 percent may still be breathing, but is in need of immediate intervention to maintain an airway and oxygenation status. This is the patient who will require the physician in the room ordering medications such as those used for rapid sequence intubation or preparing for other interventions for airway and breathing.\\n\\nPatients with chest pain must also be evaluated using the same criteria. Some patients presenting with chest pain are very stable. Although they may require a diagnostic ECG, these patients do not meet level-1 criteria. However, patients who are pale, diaphoretic, in acute respiratory distress or hemodynamically unstable will require immediate life-saving interventions and do meet level-1 criteria. Each patient with chest pain must still be evaluated within the context of the level-1 criteria to determine whether the patient requires an immediate life-saving intervention.\\n\\nWhen determining whether the patient requires immediate life-saving intervention, the triage nurse must also assess the patient's level of consciousness. The ESI algorithm uses the AVPU (alert, verbal, pain, unresponsive) scale, (see Table 3-2). The goal for this part of the algorithm is to identify the patient who has an acute change in level of consciousness. The triage nurse needs to assess this patient for a change from baseline and the critical concern is the formerly alert patient who is now labeled a P (pain) or U (unresponsive). Unresponsiveness is assessed in the context of acute changes in neurological status, not for the patient who has known developmental delays, documented dementia, or aphasia. Any patient who is unresponsive, including the intoxicated patient unresponsive to painful stimuli meets level-1 criteria and should receive immediate evaluation. An example of an acute mental status change that would require immediate intervention would be a patient with decreased mental status who is unable to maintain an airway or has severe respiratory distress.\\n\\nPrevious users of ESI version 3 (v. 3) will note a major change in the ESI level-1 criteria. The key difference between ESI v. 3 and ESI version 4 (v. 4) is the identification and re-classification of some of the sickest, previously ESI level-2 patients. Patients requiring immediate life-saving intervention are now classified as ESI level 1. In the previous ESI version, a patient in severe respiratory distress who required intubation but was still breathing was categorized as ESI level 2. In the current version, this patient meets level-1 criteria. Other examples of patients now classified as ESI level 1 include a weak and dizzy patient with a heart rate of 30 or 200. Although this change may not affect a large number of patients, it will result in the accurate categorization of the most acutely ill patients. Prior to v. 4, triage nurses were frequently confronted with two distinct levels of ESI level-2 patients; patients who required immediate evaluation and patients who could wait a brief time (10 minutes or so) without clinical deterioration. This dilemma led to a large, multi-center, prospective study that was conducted to identify characteristics of ESI level-2 patients who actually received immediate interventions (Tanabe et al., in press). Results from that multicenter study were the impetus for modifying the ESI system. This updated edition of the ESI handbook presents the changes and describes ESI v. 4.\\n\\nAn ESI level-1 patient is not always brought to the emergency department by ambulance. The patient with a drug overdose or acute alcohol intoxication may be dropped at the front door. Children may be brought by car and carried into the emergency department. The experienced triage nurse is able to instantly identify this critical patient. With a brief, across-the-room assessment the triage nurse recognizes the patient that is in extremis. This patient is taken immediately to the treatment area and resuscitation efforts are initiated.\\n\\nPatients assessed as an ESI level 1 constitute approximately 1 percent to 3 percent of all ED patients (Eitel et al., 2003; Wuerz, Milne, Eitel, Travers & Gilboy, 2000; Wuerz et al., 2001). Upon arrival, the patient's condition requires immediate resuscitation from either the emergency physician and nurse or the trauma or code team. From ESI research we know that most ESI level-1 patients are admitted to intensive care units, while some die in the emergency department (Eitel et al., 2003; Wuerz, 2001). A few ESI level-1 patients are discharged from the ED, if they have a reversible change in level of consciousness or vital functions such as hypoglycemia, seizures, alcohol intoxication, or anaphylaxis.\\n\\nExamples of ESI level 1:\\n\\n- Cardiac arrest.\\n\\n- Respiratory arrest.\\n\\n- Severe respiratory distress.\\n\\n- SpO2 < 90.\\n\\n- Critically injured trauma patient who presents unresponsive.\\n\\n- Overdose with a respiratory rate of 6.\\n\\nThree broad questions are used to determine whether the patient meets level-2 criteria.\\n\\n1. Is this a high-risk situation?\\n\\n2. Is the patient confused, lethargic or disoriented?\\n\\n3. Is the patient in severe pain or distress?\\n\\nThe triage nurse obtains pertinent subjective and objective information to quickly answer these questions. A brief introduction to ESI level-2 criteria is presented here, while a more detailed explanation of patients who meet ESI level-2 criteria will be presented in Chapter 4.\\n\\n- Severe respiratory distress with agonal or gaspingtype respirations.\\n\\n- Severe bradycardia or tachycardia with signs of hypoperfusion.\\n\\n- Hypotension with signs of hypoperfusion.\\n\\n- Trauma patient who requires immediate crystalloid and colloid resuscitation.\\n\\n- Chest pain, pale, diaphoretic, blood pressure 70/palp.\\n\\n- Weak and dizzy, heart rate = 30.\\n\\n- Anaphylactic reaction.\\n\\n- Baby that is flaccid.\\n\\n- Unresponsive with strong odor of ETOH.\\n\\n- Hypoglycemia with a change in mental status.\\n\\n##### Decision Point B: Should the Patient Wait?\\n\\nOnce the triage nurse has determined that the patient does not meet the criteria for ESI level 1, the triage nurse moves to decision point B (see Figure 33). At decision point B the nurse needs to decide whether this patient should wait to be seen. If the patient should not wait, the patient is triaged as ESI level 2. If the patient can wait, then the user moves to the next step in the algorithm.\\n\\n###### Is This a High-risk Situation?\\n\\nBased on a brief patient interview, gross observations, and finally the “sixth sense” that comes from experience, the triage nurse identifies the patient who is high risk. Frequently the patient's age and past medical history influence the triage nurse's determination of risk. A high-risk patient is one whose condition could easily deteriorate or a patient who presents with symptoms suggestive of a condition requiring time-sensitive treatment. This is a patient who has a potential major life or organ threat. A high-risk patient does not require a detailed physical assessment or even a full set of vital signs in most cases. The patient may describe a clinical portrait that the experienced triage nurse recognizes as a high-risk situation. An example of such a portrait is the patient who states, “I never get headaches and I lifted this heavy piece of furniture and now I have the worst headache of my life.” The triage nurse would triage this patient as ESI level 2 because the symptoms suggest the possibility of a subarachnoid hemorrhage.\\n\\nWhen the patient is an ESI level 2, the triage nurse has determined that it would be unsafe for the patient to remain in the waiting room for any length of time. While ESI does not suggest specific time intervals, ESI level-2 patients remain a high priority and generally placement and treatment should be initiated within 10 minutes of arrival. It is important to remember that while the level-1 criteria have expanded with v. 4 of the algorithm, ESI level-2 patients are still considered very ill and at high risk. The need for care is immediate and an appropriate bed needs to be found. Usually, rather than move to the next patient, the triage nurse feels that this patient is so sick that the charge nurse or staff in the patient care area should be immediately alerted that they have an ESI level 2.\\n\\nExamples of high-risk situations:\\n\\n- Active chest pain, suspicious for coronary syndrome, but does not require an immediate life-saving intervention, stable.\\n\\n- A needle stick in a health care worker.\\n\\n- Signs of a stroke, but does not meet level-1 criteria.\\n\\n- A rule-out ectopic pregnancy, hemodynamically stable.\\n\\n- A patient on chemotherapy, and therefore immunocompromised, with a fever.\\n\\n- A suicidal or homicidal patient.\\n\\nChapter 4 contains additional information on highrisk situations.\\n\\n###### Is the Patient Confused, Lethargic, or Disoriented?\\n\\nThis is the second question to be asked at decision point B. Again the concern is whether the patient is demonstrating an acute change in level of consciousness. Patients with a baseline mental status of confusion do not meet level-2 criteria.\\n\\n- Confused: Inappropriate response to stimuli, decrease in attention span and memory.\\n\\n- Lethargic: Drowsy, sleeping more than usual, responds appropriately when stimulated.\\n\\n- Disoriented: The patient is unable to answer questions correctly about time, place or person.\\n\\nExamples of patients who are confused, lethargic, or disoriented:\\n\\n- New onset of confusion in an elderly patient.\\n\\n- The 3-month-old whose mother reports the child is sleeping all the time.\\n\\n- The adolescent found confused and disoriented.\\n\\nEach of these examples indicates that the brain may be either structurally or chemically compromised.\\n\\n###### Is This Patient in Severe Pain or Distress?\\n\\nThe third question the triage nurse needs to answer at decision point B is whether this patient is currently in pain or distress. If the answer is “no,” the triage nurse is able to move to the next step in the algorithm. If the answer is “yes,” the triage nurse needs to assess the level of pain or distress. This is determined by clinical observation and/or a selfreported pain rating of 7 or higher on a scale of 0 to 10. When patients report pain ratings of 7/10 or greater, the triage nurse may triage the patient as ESI level 2, but is not required to assign a level-2 rating. Pain is one of the most common reasons for an ED visit and clearly all patients reporting pain 7/10 or greater do not need to be assigned an ESI level-2 triage rating. A patient with a sprained ankle and pain of 8/10 is a good example of an ESI level-4 patient. It is not necessary to rate this patient as a level 2 based on pain alone.\\n\\nIn some patients, pain can be assessed by clinical observation: distressed facial expression, diaphoresis, body posture, and changes in vital signs. The triage nurse observes physical responses to acute pain that support the patient's rating. For example, the patient with abdominal pain who is diaphoretic, tachycardic, and has an elevated blood pressure; or the patient with severe flank pain, vomiting, pale skin, and a history of renal colic are both good examples of patients that meet ESI level-2 criteria. Chapter 4 provides additional information on ESI level 2 and pain.\\n\\nSevere distress can be physiological or psychological. Examples of distress include the sexual assault victim, the combative patient, or the bipolar patient who is currently manic.\\n\\nESI level-2 patients constitute a relatively low volume, high-risk group that comprise 20 percent to 30 percent of emergency department patients (Travers et al., 2002; Wuerz et al., 2001, Tanabe, Gimbel et al., 2004). Once an ESI level-2 patient is identified, the triage nurse needs to ensure that the patient is cared for in a timely manner. Registration can be completed by a family member or at the bedside. ESI level-2 patients need vital signs and a comprehensive nursing assessment but not necessarily at triage. Placement should not be delayed to finish obtaining vital signs. ESI research has shown that 50 to 60 percent of ESI level-2 patients are admitted from the ED (Wuerz et al., 2001).\\n\\n##### Decision Point C: Resource Needs\\n\\nIf the answers to the questions at the first two decision points are “no,” then the triage nurse moves to decision point C (see Figure 3-4). The triage nurse should ask, “How many different resources do you think this patient is going to consume in order for the physician to reach a disposition decision?” The disposition decision could be to send the patient home, admit to the observation unit, admit to the hospital, or even to transfer to another institution. This decision point again requires the triage nurse to draw from past experiences in caring for similar emergency department patients. ED nurses need to clearly understand that the estimate of resources has to do with standards of care and is independent of type of hospital (i.e., teaching or non-teaching) and location. A patient presenting to any emergency department should consume the same general resources in order for a disposition to be reached. Considering the patient's brief subjective and objective assessment, past medical history, allergies, medications, age, and gender, how many different resources will be used in order for the physician to reach a disposition? In other words, what is typically done for the patient who presents to the emergency department with this common complaint? The triage nurse is asked to do this based on his or her assessment of the patient and should not consider individual practice patterns, but rather the routine practice in the particular ED.\\n\\nTo identify resource needs the triage nurse must be familiar with emergency department standards of care. The triage nurse must be knowledgeable about the concept of “prudent and customary.” One easy way to think about this concept is to ask the question “Given this patient's chief complaint or injury, what resources is the emergency physician likely to utilize?” Resources can be hospital services, tests, procedures, consults or interventions that are above and beyond the physician history and physical, or very simple emergency department interventions such as applying a bandage. Further explanations and examples are provided in Chapter 5.\\n\\nA list of what is and what is not considered a resource for purposes of ESI triage classification can be found in Table 3-3. ESI level-3 patients are predicted to require two or more resources; ESI level4 patients are predicted to require one resource; and ESI level-5 patients are predicted to require no resources (Table 3-4).\\n\\nResearch has shown that ESI level-3 patients make up 30 percent to 40 percent of patients seen in the emergency department (Eitel et al., 2003; Wuerz et al., 2001). They often require a more in-depth evaluation but are felt to be stable in the short term, and certainly may have a longer length of stay in the ED. ESI level 4 and ESI level 5 make up between 20 percent and 35 percent of ED volume, perhaps even more in a community with poor primary care access. Appropriately trained mid-level providers with the right skills mix could care for these patients in a fast-track or express care setting, recognizing that a high proportion of these patients have a trauma-related presenting complaint. Since their physical condition is stable, these patients could safely wait several hours to be seen.\\n\\n##### Decision Point D:The Patient's Vital Signs\\n\\nBefore assigning a patient to ESI level 3, the nurse needs to look at the patient's vital signs and decide whether they are outside the accepted parameters for age and are felt by the nurse to be meaningful. If the vital signs are outside accepted parameters, the triage nurse should consider upgrading the triage level to ESI level 2. However, it is the triage nurse’s decision as to whether or not the patient should be upgraded to an ESI level 2 based on vital sign abnormalities. This is decision point D.\\n\\nVital sign parameters are outlined by age (see Figure 3-5). The vital signs used are pulse, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation and, for any child under age three, body temperature. Using the vital sign criteria, the triage nurse can upgrade an adult patient who presents with a heart rate of 104, or this patient can remain ESI level 3. A 6-month-old baby with a cold and a respiratory rate of 48 could be triaged ESI level 2 or 3. Based on the patient's history and physical assessment, the nurse must ask if the vital signs are enough of a concern to say that the patient is high risk and cannot wait to be seen. Chapter 6 explains vital signs in detail and gives examples.\\n\\nTemperature is only included with children under age three. Significant fever may exclude young children from categories 4 and 5. This will help identify potentially bacteremic children and avoid sending them to a fast track setting or waiting a prolonged time. Pediatric fever guidelines will be described in detail in Chapter 6.\\n\\n###### Does Time to Treatment Influence ESI Triage Categories?\\n\\nAn estimate of how long the patient can wait to be seen by a physician is an important component of most triage systems. The Australasian and Canadian Triage Systems require patients to be seen by a physician within a specific time period, based on their triage category. ESI does not mandate specific time standards in which patients must be evaluated by a physician. However, patients who meet criteria for ESI level 2 should be seen as soon as possible; it is up to the individual institution to determine a policy. Frequently, there may be confusion between institutional policy and “flow or process of patient care” and ESI triage level.\\n\\nWe will describe four patient scenarios in which flow and triage category may seem to conflict. Often trauma patients present to the triage nurse after sustaining a significant mechanism of injury, such as an unrestrained passenger in a high-speed motor vehicle crash. The patient may have left the crash scene in some way other than by ambulance, and then presents to triage with localized right upper quadrant pain with stable vital signs. This patient is physiologically stable, walked into the ED and does not meet ESI level-1 criteria. However, the patient is at high risk for a liver laceration and other significant trauma, so should be triaged as ESI level 2. Frequently, EDs have trauma policies and trauma response level categorization that will require rapid initiation of care. Triage and trauma response level are both important and should be recorded as two different scores. While the triage nurse recognizes this is a physiologically stable trauma patient and correctly assigns ESI level 2, she should facilitate patient placement and trauma care as outlined by the trauma policy. The patient is probably stable for another 10 minutes and does not require immediate life-saving interventions. If the same patient presented with a blood pressure of 80 palpable, they would be triaged as ESI level 1 and require immediate hemodynamic, life-saving interventions.\\n\\nAnother example of policies that may affect triage level is triage of the patient with stable chest pain. If the patient is physiologically stable but experiencing chest pain that is potentially an acute coronary syndrome, the patient meets ESI level-2 criteria. They do not require immediate life-saving interventions but they are a high-risk patient. Their care is time-sensitive, an ECG should be performed within 10 minutes of patient arrival. Often, EDs will have a policy related to rapid initiation of an ECG. While care of these patients should be rapidly initiated, the ECG is not a life-saving intervention, it is a diagnostic procedure. If the triage nurse were to triage all chest pain patients as ESI level 1, it would be difficult to prioritize the care for true ESI level-1 patients who require immediate life-saving interventions. But the patient with chest pain who presents to triage diaphoretic, with a blood pressure of 80 palpable would meet ESI level-1 criteria.\\n\\nThe third example of time-sensitive care is patients who present with signs of an acute stroke. Again, if physiologically stable, a 10 minute wait to initiate care will probably not further compromise the patient. However, the patient with signs of stroke that is unable to maintain an airway meets ESI level1 criteria.\\n\\nFinally, a somewhat different scenario is an elderly patient that fell, may have a fractured hip, arrives by private car with family, and is in pain. The patient does not really meet ESI level-2 criteria but is very uncomfortable. The triage nurse would categorize the patient as ESI level 3 and probably place the patient in an available bed before other ESI level-3 patients. Ambulance patients may also present with a similar scenario. Arriving by ambulance is not a criterion to assign a patient ESI level 1 or 2. The ESI criteria should always be used to determine triage level without regard to method of arrival.\\n\\nIn general, care of ESI level-2 patients should be rapidly facilitated and patients should ideally wait no longer than 10 minutes to be placed in the treatment area. It is important to remember that while ESI v. 4 has expanded level-1 criteria to include patients requiring immediate interventions that were previously ESI level 2, all level-2 patients are still potentially very ill and require rapid initiation of care and evaluation. The triage nurse has determined that it is unsafe for these patients to wait. Patients may currently be stable, but also have a condition that can easily deteriorate, and/or initiation of diagnostic treatment may be time sensitive (stable chest pain requires an ECG in 10 minutes of arrival), or the patient has a potential major life or organ threat. ESI level-2 patients are still considered to be very high risk.\\n\\nIn the current atmosphere of ED overcrowding, it is not uncommon for the triage nurse to be in a situation of triaging many ESI level-2 patients with no open ED beds in which to place the patients. In these situations, the triage nurse may be tempted to “undertriage.” This can lead to serious, negative patient outcomes and an under-representation of the ED's overall case mix. When faced with multiple ESI level-2 patients simultaneously, the triage nurse must evaluate each patient according to the ESI algorithm. Then, the nurse can “triage” all level-2 patients to determine which patient(s) are at highest risk, in order to facilitate patient placement based on this evaluation.\\n\\n##### Summary\\n\\nIn summary, the ESI is a five-level triage system that is simple to use and divides patients by acuity and resource needs. The ESI triage algorithm is based on four key decision points. The experienced ED RN will be able to rapidly and accurately triage patients using this system.\\n\\n### Chapter 4. ESI Level 2\\n\\nThis chapter expands on the introduction to the ESI based on the experienced ED nurse's sound clinical judgment. During the ESI triage educational \\nprogram, a considerable amount of time should be devoted to explaining which types of patients should be categorized ESI level 2. In this chapter, we highlight common patient presentations that meet ESI level-2 criteria.\\n\\nAfter the triage nurse has determined that the patient does not require immediate life-saving intervention, he or she must then decide whether the patient should wait. When making this decision, the triage nurse should consider the following question “Would I use my last open bed for this patient?” The following three questions listed in Figure 4-1 should be answered and are key components of ESI level-2 criteria:\\n\\n1. Is this a high-risk situation?\\n\\n2. Is the patient experiencing new onset confusion, lethargy, or disorientation?\\n\\n3. Is the patient experiencing severe pain or distress?\\n\\nThe remainder of this chapter discusses the decision points of ESI level 2 in detail. Many examples are provided that are based on the potential medical diagnoses associated with patients' chief complaints and presenting symptoms. An experienced triage nurse will always assess the patient's chief complaint, presenting signs and symptoms, demographics, and medical history to attempt to identify a high-risk situation. While the purpose of nurse triage is not to make a medical diagnosis, these situations are based on the experienced triage nurse's knowledge of possible medical diagnoses that are associated with specific chief complaints. A good source of information about the signs and symptoms of various medical diagnoses is the Emergency Nursing Core Curriculum[©] or other emergency nursing textbooks. The following discussion provides some selected examples of highrisk situations. This discussion is not intended to be an exhaustive list. The examples are summarized in Table 4-1.\\n\\n##### High-risk Situations\\n\\nThe ability to recognize a high-risk situation is a critical element of the triage decisionmaking process, regardless of the particular triage system used. ESI highlights the importance of recognizing high-risk situations and uses the triage nurse's expertise and experience to identify patients at high risk.\\n\\nLittle has been written about how ED triage nurses make decisions. Knowledge and experience are necessary but not sufficient. The other factor that we have found to be important is gut instinct or the sixth sense. Novice triage nurses should be taught rules of thumb which they can use until they have the confidence and experience upon which to make rapid, accurate decisions. Examples of these rules of thumb include “all women of childbearing age are pregnant until proven otherwise” or “all chest pain is cardiac until proven otherwise.” Novice triage nurses are also taught symptom clustering such as the cardiac cluster of chest pain with nausea, shortness of breath, and diaphoresis. From prior clinical situations ED nurses put together what have been referred to as clinical portraits. The nurse puts into long-term memory particular patient scenarios in which they were involved in some way. For example, the patient with fever, stiff neck, and a meningococcal rash will always come to mind when a patient with a similar complaint presents to triage. The triage nurse needs to draw on all of his or her knowledge and experience with each triage encounter. High-risk situations should be easy for the experienced triage nurse to identify.\\n\\nVital signs are often not helpful in the identification of high-risk patients. The patient typically presents to the ED with a chief complaint, signs and symptoms, or history suggestive of a problem or condition that is serious and, unless dealt with promptly, can deteriorate rapidly. Often patient age, past medical history, and current medications influence the perceived severity of the chief complaint. For example, a frail elderly patient with severe abdominal pain is at a much higher risk of morbidity and mortality than a 20-year-old. The elderly patient with abdominal pain should be classified as ESI level 2, while the 20-year-old with stable vital signs will usually be classified as ESI level 3. It is common for the triage nurse to identify a high-risk situation which may then be confirmed by finding abnormal vital signs. For example, a patient who complains of a fever and productive cough may be found to have a respiratory rate of 32 and an oxygen saturation of 90 percent. The experienced triage nurse uses knowledge and expertise to recognize that this patient probably has pneumonia, is at risk for desaturating and is therefore high risk. Inexperienced ED nurses are not likely to have the knowledge and expertise to consistently identify high-risk situations and make accurate triage decisions. For this reason, the inexperienced triage nurse is, in fact, a liability at triage, regardless of the particular triage system used. They have not incorporated symptom clustering, clinical portraits, or “gut instinct” into their practice; such approaches are key in identifying the high-risk patient situation. The next section will provide specific examples of high-risk situations.\\n\\n###### Abdominal and Gastrointestinal\\n\\nAbdominal pain is a frequent chief complaint in the ED. What makes it high risk? A good history and assessment of current pain rating, respiratory rate, and heart rate are important elements to consider and will help determine the presence of a high-risk situation. Pain rating is only one of many factors to consider. Tachycardia or respiratory distress that accompanies severe abdominal pain can represent shock and would place the patient at high risk. The elderly patient with severe abdominal pain presents another potentially risky situation. Often the elderly experience bowel obstructions, gastrointestinal bleeds, and other abdominal complications associated with significantly higher morbidity and mortality than younger patients. Signs and symptoms of an acute abdomen are important to assess for in all patients with abdominal pain. How long has the patient had the pain? What made the patient come to the ED today? Has the patient had severe nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea? Is the patient dehydrated? Patients with severe “ripping” abdominal pain radiating to the back should be considered to potentially have an abdominal aortic aneurysm. Patients describe the pain as severe, constant, and sudden in onset and may have a history of hypertension.\\n\\nPatients with abdominal pain are often initially considered ESI level 3 at the beginning of the triage interview, and after the discovery of tachycardia or other risk factors, the triage nurse may determine that the patient is indeed high risk.\\n\\nVomiting blood or a chief complaint of blood per rectum should be seriously considered and evaluated in the context of vital signs. A 30-year-old with bright red blood per rectum, normal vital signs, and no other risk factors does not meet criteria for ESI level 2. But the elderly patient who called an ambulance because he started vomiting blood and has a heart rate of 117 and a respiratory rate of 24 is high risk and does meet ESI level-2 criteria.\\n\\n###### Cardiovascular\\n\\nChest pain is also a very common chief complaint. The presentation of acute coronary syndromes (ACS) is not always specific, and it is sometimes difficult to determine the risk of ACS at triage. Patients who have an episode of chest or epigastric discomfort, with or without accompanying symptoms, usually will need an ECG performed rapidly to determine the presence of ACS and need to be identified as high risk-ESI level 2. It is important for the triage nurse to incorporate into his or her knowledge of women and presentational symptoms characteristic of heart disease. The 54-year-old obese female who presents to the ED with epigastric pain and fatigue is at risk of ACS and should be assigned to ESI level 2high risk. Patients with chest pain that are physiologically unstable and require immediate intervention such as intubation or hemodynamic support should be triaged as ESI level 1. All chest pain patients do not meet level-1 or 2 criteria. For example, a 20-year-old healthy patient with chest pain, cough, and fever of 101° is at low risk for ACS and does not meet ESI level-1 or 2 criteria. Each patient must be assessed individually. Other highrisk cardiovascular situations would include the possibility of a hypertensive crisis, acute vascular arterial occlusions, and patients who present with a fever post valve replacement.\\n\\n###### Dental, Ear, Nose, and Throat\\n\\nAlthough less common, epiglottitis still exists and represents a potential airway threat. Patients with a peritonsilar abscess are another example of potential airway compromise and both conditions represent a high-risk situation. If a patient with either of these complaints is in immediate danger of airway compromise and requires immediate intervention, level-1 criteria are met. For patients with epistaxis, the triage nurse should obtain a blood pressure, although this is not in the ESI algorithm. Epistaxis could be caused by a posterior nosebleed due to a hypertensive crisis, nose picking by the patient on Coumadin®, or recent cocaine use. In any case, such patients should be classified as ESI level 2, as they represent a high-risk situation.\\n\\n###### Environmental\\n\\nPatients with inhalation injuries should be considered high risk for potential airway compromise. If the patient presents with significant airway distress and requires immediate intervention, they meet level-1 criteria.\\n\\n###### Facial\\n\\nPatients with trauma to the face should be evaluated for possible facial fractures. When present, facial fractures are often associated with other severe trauma and may potentially lead to airway compromise and should therefore be triaged as high risk. Facial trauma with actual airway compromise should be triaged as ESI level 1 to facilitate airway management High-risk of airway compromise should be triaged as ESI level 2.\\n\\n###### General Medical\\n\\nThere are several other general medical complaints that need to be considered for possible high-risk situations. These medical complications include diabetic ketoacidosis, hyper- or hypoglycemia, sepsis, complaints of syncope or near syncope, and a variety of other electrolyte disturbances that may need to be treated immediately. Hyperkalemia in particular is a very high-risk situation that can lead to serious cardiac dysrhythmias. Hyperkalemia might be suspected in a renal dialysis patient exhibiting weakness. Finally, oncology patients with a fever who are undergoing chemotherapy are at risk for sepsis and should be identified as high risk and rapidly evaluated.\\n\\n###### Genitourinary\\n\\nMales with testicular torsion will complain of severe pain, are easily recognized, and require rapid evaluation and surgical intervention, in addition to rapid pain control. Renal dialysis patients unable to complete dialysis are another example of a high-risk genitourinary emergency, since a variety of electrolyte disturbances may be present. Females, and more commonly males, can present to the triage nurse with acute urinary retention. Males over age 65 often present with benign prostatic hypertrophy and the inability to urinate. Males and females can present postoperatively with the inability to void. These patients are in acute distress and require emergency urinary catheterization. These are examples of patients in severe distress who should be categorized as ESI level 2.\\n\\n###### Mental Health\\n\\nMany patients that present with mental health problems are at high risk if they are a danger either to themselves, others, or the environment. Patients who are suicidal, homicidal, psychotic, violent, or present an elopement risk should be considered high risk. Intoxication without signs of trauma or associated risk of aspiration does not represent a high-risk criterion. The intoxicated patient needs to be carefully assessed for signs of trauma or behavioral issues related to alcohol use or past medical history. Either could represent a high-risk situation and the patient would be categorized ESI level 2.\\n\\n###### Neurological\\n\\nPatients with severe headache associated with mental status changes, high blood pressure, lethargy, fevers, or a rash should be considered high risk. Any patient with sudden onset of speech deficits or motor weakness should also be assigned ESI level 2. Patients with these symptoms may be experiencing an acute stroke and immediate evaluation is critical. Time from onset of symptoms is a critical factor in determining treatment options, in particular fibrinolytic or other therapies. A patient with no past medical history of headaches that presents to the emergency department with the sudden onset of a headache should be identified as high risk for a subarrachnoid bleed. The patient will often describe exactly what they were doing when the headache began, typically after lifting, having a bowel movement, or after sexual intercourse.\\n\\n###### Obstetrical and Gynecological\\n\\nFemales with abdominal pain or vaginal bleeding should be carefully assessed and vital signs obtained if there is no obvious life threat. Pregnancy history and last menstrual period should always be ascertained from all females of childbearing age. The triage nurse should assess for signs and symptoms of the following conditions in late pregnancy: abruptio placentae and placenta previa. In early pregnancy the triage nurse should assess for signs and symptoms of ectopic pregnancy and spontaneous abortion. All pregnant patients 14 to 20 weeks and over should be seen by a physician rapidly, according to individual institutional policy. A postpartum patient with a chief complaint of heavy vaginal bleeding should also be seen by a physician urgently. Any female patient, whether pregnant or postpartum, who presents with significant hemodynamic instability and is in need of immediate life-saving interventions should be triaged as ESI level 1.\\n\\n###### Ocular\\n\\nPatients with trauma to the eye, sudden partial or full loss of vision, or a chemical splash to the eye are at high risk for permanent damage to the eye and should be triaged at ESI level 2. Conditions associated with some type of visual loss include central retinal artery occlusion, acute narrow-angle glaucoma, and retinal detachment. Trauma to the eye can result in a globe rupture and hyphema. Chemical splashes to the eye, particularly alkali, necessitate immediate flushing to prevent further damage to the cornea. All of these conditions require immediate evaluation and treatment to prevent further complications or deterioration. These patients meet ESI level-2 criteria. While immediate irrigation is necessary, it is not considered life-saving and thus these patients do not meet ESI level-1 criteria.\\n\\n###### Orthopedic\\n\\nPatients with signs and symptoms of compartment syndrome are at high risk for extremity loss and should be assigned ESI level 2. Other patients with high-risk orthopedic injuries include any extremity injury with compromised neurovascular function, partial or complete amputations, or trauma mechanisms identified as having a high-risk such as serious acceleration or deceleration. Patients with possible fractures of the pelvis, femur, or hip and other extremity dislocations should be carefully evaluated and vital signs considered. These fractures can be associated with significant blood loss. Again, the need for immediate life-saving intervention in hemodynamically unstable patients will meet ESI level-1 criteria.\\n\\n###### Pediatrics\\n\\nIt is not uncommon for the triage nurse to be uncomfortable when making triage acuity decisions about children, especially infants. It is important to obtain an accurate history from the caregiver and evaluate the activity level of the child. The child who is inconsolable or withdrawn may be at high risk of serious illness. The following conditions are examples of high-risk situations for children:\\n\\n- Seizures.\\n\\n- Sepsis, severe dehydration.\\n\\n- Diabetic ketoacidosis.\\n\\n- Child abuse, burns.\\n\\n- Head trauma.\\n\\n- Vitamins/iron or other overdoses/ingestions.\\n\\n- Infant less than 28 days of age with a fever of 100.4° F or 38° C, or greater.\\n\\n###### Transplant\\n\\nPatients who are status post organ transplant are usually ill and considered high risk. They can present with organ rejection, sepsis, or other complications. Patients who are on a transplant list are also usually considered high risk.\\n\\n###### Respiratory\\n\\nThere are many respiratory complaints that place patients at high risk. Patients with mild-to-moderate distress should be further evaluated for respiratory rate and pulse oximetry to determine whether they should be categorized ESI level 2. Patients in severe respiratory distress that require immediate lifesaving intervention such as intubation meet level-1 criteria. The high-risk patient is one who is currently ventilating and oxygenating adequately but is in respiratory distress and has the potential to rapidly deteriorate. Potential etiologies of respiratory distress may include asthma, pulmonary embolus, pleural effusion, pneumothorax, foreign body aspiration, toxic smoke inhalation, or shortness of breath associated with chest pain.\\n\\n###### Toxicological\\n\\nMost patients who present with an overdose should be rapidly evaluated and represent a high-risk situation. It is often difficult to determine which drugs were taken and the quantities actually consumed. If the patient has taken an intentional overdose, and admits to suicidal ideation, this meets criteria for a high-risk situation. A patient who is apneic on arrival or requires other immediate lifesaving interventions should be categorized an ESI level 1; all other admitted overdoses should be considered ESI level 2.\\n\\n###### Trauma\\n\\nFrequently, patients who have been involved in a traumatic event are at high risk for injury, although no obvious injuries may be apparent. Any mechanism of injury associated with a high risk of injury should be categorized ESI level 2, unless they present with unstable vital signs and require immediate intervention. These patients should be triaged as ESI level 1. Serious injury results from the transfer of mechanical or kinetic energy and is caused by acceleration forces, deceleration forces, or both. Motor vehicle and motorcycle crashes, victims of falls, and gunshot and stab wounds are examples of blunt and penetrating trauma, which should be assessed carefully for potential for serious injury. The triage nurse should obtain the following details regarding the injury: age of the patient, pre-existing conditions of the patient and environment, distance the patient fell or jumped, how fast the vehicle was moving, history of loss of consciousness, location of penetrating injury, and type of weapon. Again, the nurse will draw from his or her knowledge of biomechanics and mechanism of injury to assess the patient and decide whether they meet ESI level-2 criteria. Gunshot wounds to the head, neck, chest, or groin usually require trauma team evaluation and immediate interventions and should be triaged as ESI level 1.\\n\\n###### Wound Management\\n\\nWhat makes a wound high risk? Is there uncontrolled bleeding? Is there arterial bleeding? Is this a partial amputation? How was the wound sustained and does the mechanism of injury leave the patient at high risk for other traumatic complications? Most wounds do not meet the criteria for ESI level 2. A patient with a stab wound to the subcutaneous tissue of the thigh with controlled bleeding and good distal neurological function can be classified as ESI level 4. Any uncontrolled bleeding that requires immediate lifesaving intervention to stabilize the patient meets level-1 criteria.\\n\\n##### Confusion/Lethargy/ Disorientation\\n\\nThe second question to consider when determining whether a patient meets level-2 criteria is “Does the patient have new onset confusion, lethargy, or disorientation?” Altered mental status is another frequent chief complaint. Family members, friends, or paramedics may accompany these patients to the ED. At decision point B of the ESI algorithm, the presence of confusion, lethargy, or disorientation refers to new onset or an acute alteration in level of consciousness (LOC). Chronic dementia and confusion do not meet criteria for ESI level 2. Confusion, lethargy, or disorientation may be caused by a variety of serious medical conditions including stroke, transient ischemic attack, and other structural pathology to the brain, metabolic, and electrolyte imbalances such as hypoglycemia or hyponatremia and toxicological conditions.\\n\\nThis portion of the algorithm is usually very clear and leaves very little open to interpretation. If the patient's history is unknown and the patient presents to triage confused, lethargic or disoriented, the triage nurse should assume this condition is new and select ESI level 2 as the triage category. Again, if the patient has new onset confusion, lethargy or disorientation and requires an immediate life-saving intervention as previously described, the patient then meets ESI level-1 criteria.\\n\\n##### Severe Pain/Distress\\n\\nThe final question to address when determining whether the patient meets level-2 criteria is “Does the patient have severe pain or distress?” The patient should be assessed for the presence of severe pain or distress. All patients who have a pain rating of 7/10 or greater should be considered for meeting ESI level2 criteria.\\n\\n_Considered is a very important word. It is up to the_ discretion of the triage nurse to determine whether the clinical condition and pain rating in combination warrant a rating of ESI level 2. For example, a patient who had a heavy metal object fall on his toe may rate the pain a 10/10. Indeed, the patient may have a fracture and is experiencing severe pain. The patient probably has done nothing to try to relieve the pain prior to arrival in the ED. The correct triage level for this patient would be ESI level 4. Only one resource will be needed (an x-ray). The triage nurse should implement comfort measures at triage including ice, elevation, and analgesics (if standing orders are in place) to reduce the pain. The triage nurse should believe the patient's pain is 10/10 and address the pain at triage. However, this patient can wait to be seen and you would certainly not use your last open bed for this patient. In summary, the triage nurse assesses not only the pain intensity rating provided by the patient, but also the chief complaint, past medical history and physiologic appearance of the patient when determining a triage category. Examples of patients for whom the triage nurse could use severe pain criteria to justify an ESI level-2 rating include:\\n\\n- A patient with 10/10 flank pain who is writhing at triage.\\n\\n- An 80-year-old female with 7/10 generalized abdominal pain with severe nausea.\\n\\n- A 30-year-old patient in acute sickle cell pain crisis.\\n\\n- An oncology patient with severe pain.\\n\\n- Any full- or partial-thickness burn that will require immediate pain control.\\n\\nAll ED patients are to be assessed for pain and asked to rate their pain using a scale such as the visual analog scale. Many triage nurses are uncomfortable with documenting a patients pain rating and then having them wait to be seen. It is important for the triage nurse to understand that the patients self reported pain rating is only one piece of the pain assessment. For example, all ED triage nurses have triaged patients who are laughing, talking on their cell phone or eating chips but report their pain is 10+. Triage nurses should assign ESI level 2 if the patient reports a pain rating of 7/10 or greater and the triage nurse's subjective and objective assessment confirms that the patient's pain requires interventions that are beyond the scope of triage. The triage nurse concludes that it would be inappropriate for this patient to wait and they would assign this patient to the last open bed.\\n\\nFinally, in determining whether a patient meets ESI level-2 criteria, the triage nurse must assess for severe distress, which is defined as either physiological or psychological. In addition to pain, patients experiencing severe respiratory distress meet criteria for ESI level 2 for physiological disturbances. Examples of severe psychological distress include patients who are:\\n\\n- Distraught after experiencing a sexual assault.\\n\\n- Exhibiting behavioral outbursts at triage.\\n\\n- Combative.\\n\\n- Victims of domestic violence.\\n\\n- Experiencing an acute grief reaction.\\n\\nThese are patients that the triage nurse usually prefers to have placed in the treatment area immediately so as to have the patient avoid the waiting room.\\n\\n##### Summary\\n\\nWe have reviewed the key components and questions that need to be answered to determine whether a patient meets ESI level-2 criteria. It is critical that the triage nurse consider these questions as he or she triages each patient. “Missing” a highrisk situation may result in an extended waiting period and potentially negative patient outcomes.\\n\\n### Chapter 5. Expected Resource Needs\\n\\nTraditionally, triage systems have been based solely upon the acuity of the patient. Such systems require the nurse to assign an acuity level by making a judgment about how long the patient can wait to be seen by a provider. The Emergency Severity Index (ESI) triage system uses a novel approach to triage level assignment by including not only judgments about who should be seen first, but also for the less acute patients, adding predictions of the resources that are likely to be used to make a disposition for the patient. This chapter includes background information on why resource predictions were included in the ESI and a description of what constitutes a resource. Also included are examples of patients rated ESI level 3 to 5 and the resources that each patient is predicted to need.\\n\\nHistorically, comprehensive triage has been the dominant model for triage acuity assignment in U.S. emergency departments (Emergency Nurses Association [ENA], 1997, p. 3-10; Gilboy, Travers & Wuerz, 1999). Triage systems have been based on the nurse’s assessment of vital signs, subjective and objective information, past medical history, allergies, and medications to determine triage acuity.\\n\\nResource prediction is an integral part of the ESI for patients identified as ESI level 3, 4, or 5. It is important to understand that resource allocation does not have a role for patients of high acuity, e.g. ESI level 1 or 2. Resource prediction distinguishes the ESI from other triage systems that are based only on acuity. When Drs. Wuerz and Eitel created the ESI triage system, they added resource utilization to provide additional data and allow a better, more accurate triage decision. They believed that an experienced emergency department (ED) triage nurse was able to predict the nature and number of tests, therapeutic interventions, and consultations that a patient would need during his/her ED stay. This has been verified in recent studies of ESI implementation and validation, which have shown that triage nurses are able to predict ED patients' resource needs (Eitel, Travers, Rosenau, Gilboy & Wuerz, 2003; Tanabe, Gimbel, Yarnold & Adams, 2004). One study was conducted at seven EDs representing varied regions of the country, urban and rural areas, and academic and community hospitals. Nurses using the ESI were able to predict how many resources the ED patients required 70 percent of the time. That is, ESI classification by experienced triage nurses reasonably predicts at triage how many resources patients will require to reach ED disposition, but, more importantly, discriminates at presentation low versus high resource intensity patients. This differentiation by resource requirements allows for much more effective streaming of patients at ED presentation into alternative operational pathways within the ED, that is, the parallel processing of patients. Research has also established that ESI triage levels correlate with important patient outcomes, including admission and mortality rates (Eitel et al., 2003).\\n\\nAgain, it is important to note that resource prediction is only used for less acute patients. At decision points A and B on the ESI algorithm (Figure 5-1), the nurse decides which patients meet criteria for ESI levels 1 and 2 based only on patient acuity. However, at decision point C, the nurse assigns ESI levels 3 to 5 by assessing both acuity and predicted resource needs. Thus, the triage nurse only considers resources when the answers to decision points A and B are “no.”\\n\\nTo identify ED patients' resource needs, the triage nurse must be generally familiar with emergency department standards of care, and, specifically, what constitutes prudent and customary emergency care. An easy way to think about this concept is to ask the question, “Given this patient's chief complaint, what resources are the emergency providers likely to utilize?”\\n\\nThe triage nurse uses information from the brief subjective and objective triage assessment, as well as past medical history, medications, age, and gender, to determine how many different resources will be needed for the ED provider to reach a disposition. For example, a healthy teenage patient with a simple leg laceration and no prior medical history would need only one resource: Suturing. On the other hand, an older adult with multiple chronic medical problems and no history of dizziness who presents with a head laceration from a fall will clearly need multiple resources: suturing, plus blood/urine tests, ECG, and x-rays or consultations with specialists. Accurate use of ESI triage is contingent on the nurses' ability to predict resources and as such is best performed by an experienced emergency nurse. In general, we believe that no matter what triage system is used, an experienced emergency nurse is needed to safely perform triage.\\n\\nGuidelines for the categorization of resources in the ESI triage system are shown in Table 5-1 (repeat of Table 3-1). ESI levels 3, 4, and 5 are differentiated by the nurse's determination of how many resources are needed to make a patient disposition. On the basis of the triage nurse's predictions, patients who are expected to consume no resources are classified as level 5, those who are likely to require one resource are level 4, and those who are expected to need two or more resources are designated as ESI level 3. Patients who need two or more resources have been shown to have higher rates of hospital admission and mortality and longer lengths of stay in the ED (Eitel et al., 2003; Tanabe et al., 2004 Reliability and validity).\\n\\nThough the list of resources in Table 5-1 is not exhaustive, it provides general guidance on the types of diagnostic tests, procedures, and therapeutic treatments that constitute a resource in the ESI system. Emergency nurses who use the ESI are cautioned not to become overly concerned about the definitions of individual resources. It is important to remember that ESI requires the triage nurse to merely estimate resources that the patient will need while in the ED. The most common resources are listed in Table 5-1; however a comprehensive list of every possible ED resource is neither practical nor necessary. In fact, all that is really necessary for accurate ESI rating is to predict whether the patient will need no resources, one, or two or more resources. Once a triage nurse has identified two probable resources, there is no need to continue to estimate resources. The essence of the ESI resource component is to separate more complex (resource-intensive) patients from those with simpler problems. The interventions considered as resources for the purposes of ESI triage are those that indicate a level of assessment or procedure beyond an exam or brief interventions by ED staff and/or involve personnel outside of the ED. Resources that require significant ED staff time (such as intravenous medication administration or chest tube insertion) and those that require staff or resources outside the ED (such as x-rays by the radiology staff or surgical consults) increase the patient's ED length of stay and indicate that the patient's complexity, and, therefore, triage level is higher.\\n\\nThere are some common questions about what is considered an ESI resource. First, there is often a question about the number of blood or urine tests and x-rays that constitute a resource. In the ESI triage method, the triage nurse should count the number of different types of resources needed to determine the patient's disposition, not the number of individual tests.\\n\\n- A complete blood count (CBC) and electrolyte panel comprise one resource (lab test).\\n\\n- A CBC and chest x-ray are two resources (lab test, x-ray).\\n\\n- A CBC and a urinalysis are both lab tests and together count as only one resource.\\n\\n- A chest x-ray and plain skull films are one resource (x-ray).\\n\\n- A cervical-spine films and a computerized tomography (CT) scan of the head are two resources (x-ray and CT scan).\\n\\nAnother resource frequently questioned is the application of a splint, which does not count as a resource. If a splint did count, patients with sprained ankles would be triaged as ESI level 3 (x-ray and splint application). While the application of a splint can certainly be resource intensive, it is important to remember the only purpose of resource prediction is to sort patients into distinct groups and help get the right patient to the right area of the ED. In many EDs, ESI level-3 patients are not appropriate for a fast track or urgent care area. Triage scores are not a measure of total nursing workload intensity.\\n\\nAnother common question about ESI resources relates to the fact that eye irrigation is also considered a resource. Patients with a chemical splash usually meet ESI level-2 criteria because of the high-risk nature of the splash, so eye irrigation is not a key factor in their ESI rating. However, if the eye problem was due to dust particles in the eye, the patient would not necessarily be high risk. In this type of patient, the eye irrigation would count as a resource and the patient would meet ESI level-4 criteria. The eye exam does not count as a resource because it is considered part of the physical exam. Other common questions about resources are addressed in the Chapter 5 Frequently Asked Questions section of Appendix A.\\n\\nAnother frequent question posed by clinicians is related to the items listed as “not resources” in Table 5-1. The purpose of the list is to assist triage nurses with quick, accurate sorting of patients into five clinically distinct levels (Wuerz, Milne, Eitel, Travers & Gilboy, 2000). As such, items listed as not being resources include physical exams, point-of-care tests, and interventions that tend not to lead to increased length of stay in the ED or indicate a higher level of complexity. Since the standard of care is that all ED patients undergo a basic history and physical exam, an exam and even a pelvic exam does not constitute a resource for ESI classification. The beauty of the ESI is its simplicity; the true goal of the resource determination is to differentiate the more complicated patients needing two or more resources (level 3 or above) from those with simpler problems who are likely to need fewer than two resources (level 4 or 5). Emergency nurses should not try to complicate ESI by concentrating overly on resource definitions. Usually, a patient requires either no resources, one, or two or more resources.\\n\\nThough resource consumption may vary by site, provider, and even individual patient, triage nurses are urged to make the ESI resource prediction by thinking about the common approaches to the most common presenting problems. Ideally, a patient presenting to any emergency department should consume the same general resources. For example, a provider seeing an 82-year-old nursing home resident who has an in-dwelling urinary catheter and a chief complaint of fever and cough will most likely order blood and urine tests and a chest x-ray. The triage nurse can accurately predict that the patient needs two or more resources and therefore classify the patient as ESI level 3.\\n\\nThere may be minor variations in operations at different EDs, but this will rarely affect the triage rating. For example, some departments do pregnancy tests in the ED (not a resource by ESI) and others send them to the lab (a resource by ESI). However, patients rarely have the pregnancy test as their only resource, so most of those patients tend to have two or more resources in addition to the pregnancy test. One ED practice variation that may result in different ESI levels for different sites is the evaluation of patients with an isolated complaint of sore throat. At some hospitals it is common practice to obtain throat cultures (one resource, ESI level 4), while at others it is not (no resources, ESI level 5). Another example of different site practice variation is the use of the Ottowa Ankle Rules. These are validated rules used to determine the need for an xray of the ankle for patients that present with ankle injuries. Institutional adoption of these rules into practice varies. Institutions that use these rules at triage may obtain fewer x-rays when compared with institutions that do not routinely use these rules.\\n\\nTemperature is an important assessment parameter for determining the number of resources for very young children. This subject will be covered in Chapter 6.\\n\\nFrom a clinical standpoint, ESI level 4 and 5 patients can wait several hours to be seen by a provider. However, from a customer service standpoint, these patients are perhaps better served in a fast-track or urgent care setting. Mid-level practitioners with the appropriate skills mix and supervision could care for level-4 and 5 patients. The ESI provides yet another operational advantage, in that level-5 patients can sometimes be “worked in” for a quick exam and disposition by the provider, even if the department is at capacity. Often triage policies clearly state ESI level-4 or 5 patients can be triaged to an urgent care or fast-track area.\\n\\nIn summary, the ESI provides an innovative approach to ED triage with the inclusion of predictions about the number of resources needed to make a patient disposition. Consideration of resources is included in the triage level assignment for ESI level-3, 4, and 5 patients, while ESI level-1 and 2 decisions are based only on patient acuity. Examples of ESI level-3, 4, and 5 patients are shown in Table 5-2. Practical experience has demonstrated that resource estimation is very beneficial in helping sort the large number of patients with non-acute presentations.\\n\\n### Chapter 6.The Role of Vital Signs in ESI Triage\\n\\n##### Introduction Figure 6-1. Danger Zone Vital Signs\\n\\nIn this chapter, we focus on decision point D—the patient's vital signs. To reach this point in the ESI \\nalgorithm, the triage nurse has already determined \\nthat the patient does not meet ESI level-1 or 2 \\ncriteria, and that he or she will require two or more \\nresources. Since the patient requires two or more resources, he or she meets the criteria for at least an \\nESI level 3. It is at this point in the algorithm that \\nvital signs data are considered, so the triage nurse's next step is to assess the patient's heart rate, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation, and, when appropriate (for children under age 3), temperature. If the danger zone vital sign limits are exceeded (as illustrated in decision point D, Figure 6-1), the triage nurse must strongly consider up-triaging the patient from a level 3 to a level 2.\\n\\nDuring the ESI triage educational program, a considerable amount of time should be devoted to exploring the importance of vital signs in the decision to move a patient from ESI level 3 to an ESI level 2. It should be stressed that it is always the decision of the experienced triage nurse to determine whether the patient meets criteria for ESI level 2, based upon their past medical history, current medications, and subjective and objective assessment that includes general appearance. This decision is based on the triage nurse's clinical judgment and knowledge of normal vital sign parameters for all ages and the influence of factors such as medications, past medical history, and pain level.\\n\\n##### What Are Vital Signs?\\n\\nVital signs traditionally include simple measurements of physiological parameters including temperature, blood pressure, pulse, and respiratory rate as well as pulse oximetry (see Table 6-1). They frequently prompt a health care worker to follow a particular path of action. Recently, the nursing literature has placed increased emphasis on pain. The American Pain Society adopted the phrase “Pain: the fifth vital sign” to increase healthcare workers' awareness of the importance of assessment and management of pain. Pain assessment is an important component of ESI and is actually assessed earlier in the algorithm. So, for the purpose of ESI, heart rate, respiratory rate, oxygen saturation and temperature in children under age 3 are the vital sign parameters considered in decision point D. Vital signs represent a set of objective data for use in determining general parameters of patients' health and viability. The values we obtain influence our interpretation of a patient's overall condition and, therefore, the path we take in establishing a diagnosis and treatment for the patient. However, vital signs alone do not paint a complete picture of the patient's condition. Vital signs may be affected by a variety of factors including prescription medications, herbals, and recreational drugs. For example, beta-blockers cause bradycardia and blunt the tachycardic response to shock. Hypothyroidism, common in the elderly, may lead to the finding of low temperature, even in the face of sepsis. A young adult may have an elevated body temperature due to recreational drug use.\\n\\nVital signs are variable, dynamic indicators that are an adjunct to a patient's evaluation. Vital sign measurements may also be operator dependent, and the definition of normal vital signs varies according to the reference consulted. Even under the best conditions, vital signs are not always reliable or accurate (Edmonds, Mower, Lovato & Lomeli, 2002). The patient's general appearance and clinical picture frequently prove to be of the most value. However, if in a triage nurse's judgment, knowing a patient's vital signs would help with risk analysis, then vital signs should be measured. For example, if the patient is using immunosuppressive medications or chemotherapy or is immunosuppressed by an illness such as AIDS, then the body temperature should be measured.\\n\\n##### Are Vital Signs Necessary at Triage?\\n\\nPrior to the advent of five-level triage in the United States, tradition dictated that every patient presenting to an emergency department should have a set of vital signs taken before triage level assignment. Vital signs were considered an integral component of the initial nursing assessment and were often used as a decisionmaking tool. In a traditional three-level triage system, vital signs helped determine how long a patient could wait for treatment (i.e., if no abnormal vital signs were present, in many cases, the patient could wait a longer period of time). Vital signs, therefore, in the past weighted heavily in the patient triage assessment, with variable emphasis placed on the clinical presentation.\\n\\nMore recently, newer triage models advocate selective use of vital signs at triage (Gilboy, Travers & Wuerz, 2000). Initial vital signs are not a mandatory component of other five-level triage systems and in general are not reported during the triage phase of a level-1 or 2 patient (i.e., those patients with the highest acuity). For example, the Guidelines for _Implementation of the Australasian Triage Scale in_ _Emergency Departments states that “vital signs should_ only be measured at triage if required to estimate urgency, or if time permits” (Australasian College for Emergency Medicine, 2000). Similarly, the Canadian Triage and Acuity Scale (CTAS) upholds the need for vital signs if, and only if, they are necessary to determine a triage level (in the cases of levels 3, 4, and 5) as time permits (Beveridge et al., 2002. The Manchester Triage Group uses specific vital sign parameters as discriminators within a presentational flow chart. The vital sign parameter is one of the factors that help the triage nurse assign an acuity level.\\n\\nVital signs may not always be the most appropriate tool to determine triage acuity. At least one study has suggested that vital signs are not always necessary in the initial assessment of the patient at triage. In 2002, Cooper, Flaherty, Lin, and Hubbell examined the use of vital signs to determine a patient's triage status. They considered age and communication ability as factors. Twenty-four different U.S. emergency departments and more than 14,000 patients participated in that study. Final results demonstrated that vital signs changed the level of triage acuity status in only eight percent of the cases. When further examining individual age groups, pediatric patients age 2 or younger showed the largest variation in triage decision with an 11.4 percent change once vital signs were collected.\\n\\n##### Vital Signs and ESI Triage\\n\\nUsing ESI triage, the only absolute requirement for vital signs assessment is for patients who don't initially meet ESI level-1 or 2 criteria, but who are predicted to need two or more resources. Assessment of vital signs at triage is optional and at the discretion of the triage nurse for patients triaged as ESI level 1, 2, 4, or 5. While the ESI system does not require vital signs assessment on all patients who present to triage, local policies may dictate a different procedure. Factors such as staffing levels, casemix, and local resources influence individual hospital policies regarding vital signs at triage and are beyond the scope of this handbook. In general when triaging a stable patient, it is never wrong to obtain a set of vital signs. ESI requires vital signs for only level-3 patients. (See Table 6-2)\\n\\nThe developers of the ESI and the current ESI research team believe that experienced ED nurses can use vital sign data as an adjunct to sound clinical judgment when rating patients with the ESI. There is limited evidence on vital sign abnormalities as they relate to ED acuity and that are proven to truly represent serious illness. The ESI has been revised over time to reflect changes in the available evidence and recommendations from the literature. The ESI working group initially used the systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) literature (Rangel-Frausto et al., 1995) in developing the danger zone vital sign box and accompanying footnotes. The first version of the ESI used the SIRS criteria to include a heart rate of greater than 90 (for adults) as an absolute indicator to up-triage from ESI level 3 to level 2 (Wuerz, Milne, Eitel, Traers & Gilboy, 2000). The SIRS research was based on predictors of mortality in an intensive care unit population. Based on an excess of false positives using these criteria for ED patients at the initial ESI hospitals, the heart rate cutoff was changed to 100 in ESI version 2, and nurses were instructed to consider up-triage to ESI 2 for adult patients with heart rates greater than 100 (Wuerz et al., 2001; Gilboy, Tanabe, Travers, Eitel & Wuerz, 2003). Additionally, pediatric vital signs were added to the danger zone vital signs box.\\n\\nWhen using ESI as a triage system, vital signs assessment is not necessary in the triage area for patients who are immediately categorized as level 1 or 2. If the patient appears unstable or presents with a chief complaint that necessitates immediate treatment, then transport of the patient directly to the treatment area should be expedited. For these patients, the resuscitation team is responsible for obtaining and monitoring vital signs at the bedside. This would include patients that have clinical appearances that indicate high risk or need for immediate cardiovascular or respiratory intervention. These patients may appear pale, diaphoretic, or cyanotic. However, the triage nurse has the option to perform vitals in the triage area, if an open bed is not immediately available or if he or she feels that the vital signs may assist in confirming the triage acuity level. Some patients may not initially be identified as ESI level 1 until vital signs are taken. For example, an awake, alert elderly patient who complains of dizziness might be found to have a life-threatening condition when a heart rate of 32 or 180 is discovered during vital sign measurement.\\n\\nAs shown in the ESI algorithm in Chapter 3, if patients do not meet ESI level-1 or 2 criteria, the triage nurse comes to decision point C. The nurse then determines how many resources the patient is expected to need in the ED. If the patient is expected to need one or no resources, he or she can be assigned an ESI level of 4 or 5 and no vital sign assessment is necessary. But if the patient is expected to need two or more resources, then the nurse comes to decision point D and vital signs should be assessed. Vital signs can play a more important role in the evaluation of some patients at triage, especially those triaged as ESI level 3. The range of vital signs may provide supporting data for potential indicators of serious illness. If any of the danger zone vital signs are exceeded, it is recommended that the triage nurse consider up-triaging the patient from level 3 to level 2.\\n\\nVital signs that are explicitly included in ESI triage are heart rate, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation (for patients with potential respiratory compromise). Temperature is specifically used in ESI triage for children under age 3 (see below). It is important to note that when considering abnormal vital signs, blood pressure is not included in the ESI algorithm. This does not mean that the triage nurse should not take a blood pressure or a temperature on older children or adults but that these vital signs are not necessarily used to assist in selecting the appropriate triage acuity level.\\n\\n##### Vital Signs and Pediatric Fever\\n\\nIn this version of the ESI Handbook, version 4 (v.4) of the ESI algorithm has been updated to include more current pediatric fever criteria. As shown in Figure 6-2, note D of the ESI algorithm addresses pediatric fever considerations for ESI triage. This section incorporates recommendations from the American College of Emergency Physicians' Clinical Policy for Children Younger Than Three Years Presenting to the Emergency Department With Fever (ACEP, 2003).\\n\\nThe ESI Triage Research Team recommends that vital signs in patients under age 3 be assessed at triage. In particular, temperature measurement is important during triage of all children from newborn through 36 months of age, and vital sign evaluation is essential to the overall assessment of a known febrile infant under age 36 months (Baraff, 2000). This helps to differentiate ESI level-2 and 3 patients and minimize the risk that potentially bacteremic children will be sent to an express care area or otherwise experience an inappropriate wait. Remember, if a patient is in immediate danger or high risk, he or she will be assigned to either ESI level 1 or 2.\\n\\nTable 6-3 provides direction for the triage nurse in using the ESI to assess the febrile child and determine the most appropriate triage level. The generally accepted definition of fever is a rectal temperature greater than 38.0° C (100.4° F) (Baraff et al., 1993; ACEP, 2003). The infant less than 28 days old with a fever should be considered high risk and assigned to at least ESI level 2. There are no clear guidelines for the infant between 28 days and 3 months of age. The ESI research team recommends triage nurses rely on local hospital guidelines. We suggest that the nurse consider assigning at least an ESI level 2 for such patients.\\n\\nIn v. 4 of the ESI, we have incorporated a different set of pediatric fever guidelines for children ages 3 to 36 months. These pediatric fever considerations pertain to highly febrile children, defined as those with a fever of greater than 39.0° C (102.2° F) (ACEP, 2003). When triaging a child between 3 and 36 months of age who is highly febrile, it is important for the triage nurse to assess the child's immunization status and whether there is an identifiable source for the fever. The patient with incomplete immunizations or with no identifiable source for the fever should be assigned to at least ESI level 3. If the patient has an identifiable source for the fever and his or her immunizations are up to date, then a rating of 4 or 5 is appropriate. For example, a 7-month-old who is followed by a pediatrician, has had the Haemophilus influenza type b (HIB) vaccine and presents with a fever and pulling on his ear could be assigned to an ESI level 5.\\n\\n##### Case Examples\\n\\nThe following case studies are examples of how vital signs data are used in ESI triage.\\n\\n- “My doctor told me I am about 6 weeks pregnant and now I think I am having a miscarriage,” reports a healthy looking 28-year-old female. “I started spotting this morning and now I am cramping.” No allergies, no PMH, medications: prenatal vitamins. Vital signs: T 98° F, HR 112, RR 22, BP 90/60.\\n\\nThis patient meets the criteria for being up-triaged from a level 3 to a level 2 based on her vital signs. Her increased heart rate, respiratory rate, and decreased blood pressure are a concern. These factors could indicate internal bleeding from a ruptured ectopic pregnancy.\\n\\n- “The baby has had diarrhea since yesterday. The whole family has had that GI bug that is going around,” reports the mother of a 15-month-old. She tells you the baby has had a decreased appetite, a low-grade temperature, and numerous liquid stools. The baby is sitting quietly on the mother's lap. The triage nurse notes signs of dehydration. No PMH, NKDA, no medications. Vital signs: T 100.4° F, HR 142, RR 48, BP 76/50.\\n\\nThis patient meets the criteria for at least ESI level 3. For resources he would require labs and IV fluid. Based on his vital signs the triage nurse can uptriage him to an ESI level 2. For a baby this age, both heart rate and respiratory rate criteria are violated.\\n\\n- “I need to see a doctor for my cough. I just can't seem to shake it. Last night I didn't get much sleep because I was coughing so much, I am just so tired,” reports a 57-year-old female. She tells you that she had a temperature of 101° last night and that she is coughing up this yellow stuff. Her history includes a hysterectomy 3 years ago; she takes no medications but is allergic to Penicillin. Vital signs: T 101.4°, RR 28, HR 100, SpO2 90 percent.\\n\\nAt the beginning of her triage assessment, this patient sounds as though she could have pneumonia. She will need two or more resources but her low oxygen saturation and increased respiratory rate are a concern. After looking at her vital signs the triage nurse should up-triage the patient to an ESI level 2.\\n\\n- A 34-year-old obese female presents to triage complaining of generalized abdominal pain (pain scale rating: 6/10) for 2 days. She has vomited several times and states her last bowel movement was 3 days ago. She has a history of back surgery, takes no medications, and is allergic to peanuts. Vital signs: T 97.8° F, HR 104, RR 16, BP 132/80, SpO2 99 percent.\\n\\nThis patient will need a minimum of two or more resources: lab, IV fluids, perhaps IV medication for nausea, and a CT scan. The triage nurse would review the patient's vital signs and consider the heart rate. The heart rate falls just outside the accepted parameter for the age of the patient but could be due to pain or exertion. In this case, the decision should be to assign the patient to ESI level 3.\\n\\n- A tearful 9-year-old presents to triage with her mother. She slipped on an icy sidewalk and injured her right forearm. The forearm is obviously deformed but has good color, sensation, and movement. The mother reports she has no allergies, takes no medications, and is healthy. Vital signs: BP 100/68, HR 124, RR 32, and SpO2 99 percent.\\n\\nThis child is experiencing pain from her fall and is obviously upset. She will require at least two resources: x-ray and orthopedic consult, and perhaps conscious sedation. Her heart rate and respiratory rate are elevated, but the triage nurse should feel comfortable assigning this patient to ESI level 3. Her vital sign changes are likely due to pain and distress.\\n\\n- A 72-year-old patient presents to the ED with her oxygen via nasal cannula for her advanced COPD. She informs the triage nurse that she has an infected cat bite on her left hand. The hand is red, tender, and swollen. The patient has no other medical problems, uses albuterol prn, and takes an aspirin daily, NKDA. Vital signs: T 99.6° F, HR 88, RR 22, BP 138/80, SpO2 91 percent. She denies respiratory distress.\\n\\nThis patient will require two or more resources: labs and IV antibiotics. She meets the criteria for ESI level 3. The triage nurse notices that her oxygen saturation and respiratory rate are outside the accepted parameters for the adult but this patient has advanced COPD. These vital signs are not a concern so the patient will not be up-triaged but will stay an ESI level 3.\\n\\n##### Case Examples\\n\\nThe following case studies are examples of how vital signs data are used in ESI triage.\\n\\n- “My doctor told me I am about 6 weeks pregnant and now I think I am having a miscarriage,” reports a healthy looking 28-year-old female. “I started spotting this morning and now I am cramping.” No allergies, no PMH, medications: prenatal vitamins. Vital signs: T 98° F, HR 112, RR 22, BP 90/60.\\n\\nThis patient meets the criteria for being up-triaged from a level 3 to a level 2 based on her vital signs. Her increased heart rate, respiratory rate, and decreased blood pressure are a concern. These factors could indicate internal bleeding from a ruptured ectopic pregnancy.\\n\\n- “The baby has had diarrhea since yesterday.

We addressed the special case of patients under 36 months of age. Further research is necessary to clarify the best vital sign thresholds used in emergency department triage. Further study will also examine pediatric populations presenting to the emergency department. It is our hope that future versions of the ESI will be based on additional evidence regarding the predictive value of triage vital signs for pediatric and adult patients.\\n\\n### Appendix A. Frequently Asked Questions\\n\\n##### Chapter 3.\\n\\n###### Frequently Asked Questions\\n\\n1. Do I have to upgrade the adult patient’s triage level if the heart rate is greater than 100?\\n\\nNo, it is a factor to consider.\\n\\n2. Do I have to upgrade the patient’s triage level if the pain rating is 7/10 or greater?\\n\\nNo, again this is one factor to consider.\\n\\n3. If the patient is chronically confused, should the patient then automatically be categorized as ESI level 2?\\n\\nNo, an ESI level 2 is assigned to patients with an acute change in level of consciousness.\\n\\n4. When do I need to measure vital signs?\\n\\nFor any patient who meets ESI level-3 criteria. Vital signs are always obtained if the triage nurse determines they may be useful.\\n\\n##### Chapter 4.\\n\\n###### Frequently Asked Questions\\n\\n1. Do I have to assign the ESI triage category of 2 for the 25-year-old female patient who rates her pain as 10/10 and is eating potato chips?\\n\\nNo. With stable vital signs and no other factors that would meet high-risk criteria, this patient should be assigned ESI level 3. She will most likely need labs, and either x-rays, an IV, or pain medications, i.e., two or more resources. You would not use your last open bed for her.\\n\\n2. Does an 80-year-old female who is chronically confused need to be triaged as ESI level 2?\\n\\nNo. The new onset of confusion, lethargy, or disorientation meet criteria for ESI level 2.\\n\\n3. Shouldn’t the patient with active chest pain be rated an ESI level 1? After all, they should be the highest priority.\\n\\nNot all patients with chest pain meet ESI level-1 criteria. If they are unresponsive, pulseless, apneic or not breathing, or require immediate life saving intervention, they meet level-1 criteria. A chest pain patient that is pale, diaphoretic, hypotensive, or bradycardic will require immediate IV access to improve their hemodynamic status is level 1. Stable patients with active chest pain usually meet high-risk criteria and should be categorized ESI level 2; immediate placement should be facilitated.\\n\\n##### Chapter 5.\\n\\n###### Frequently Asked Questions\\n\\n1. Why isn’t crutch-walking instruction a resource?\\n\\nThough crutch-walking instruction may consume a fair amount of the ED staff members’ time, it is often provided to patients who have simple ankle sprains. These patients are typically classified as ESI level 4 (ankle x-ray = one resource). The patients are clearly less acute and less resource intensive than more complex patients like those with tibia/fibula fractures who are usually ESI level 3 (leg films, orthopedic consult, cast/splint, IV pain medications = two or more resources). A better way to reflect the ED staff’s efforts for crutch-walking instruction is with a nursing resource intensity measure.\\n\\n2. Why isn’t a splint a resource?\\n\\nThe application of simple, pre-formed splints (such as splints for ankle sprains) is not considered a resource. In contrast, the creation and application of splints by ED staff, such as thumb spica splints for thumb fractures, does constitute a resource. A helpful way to differentiate patients with extremity trauma is as follows: patients with likely fractures should be rated ESI 3 (two or more resources: x-ray, pain medications, creation and application of splints/casts), whereas patients more likely to have simple sprains can be rated as ESI level 4.\\n\\n3. Why isn’t a saline or heparin lock a resource?\\n\\nGenerally speaking, insertion of a heparin lock doesn’t consume a large amount of ED staff time. However, many patients who have heparin locks inserted also have at least two other resources (e.g., laboratory tests, intravenous medications) and are therefore classified as ESI level 3 anyway.\\n\\n4. Are all conscious sedation patients ESI level 3 or higher?\\n\\nYes, conscious sedation is considered a complex procedure (two resources) and is generally performed with patients who also have laboratory tests or x-rays, and other procedures such as fracture reduction or dilation and curettage.\\n\\n5. Which of the following are considered resources: eye irrigation, nebulized medication administration, and blood transfusions?\\n\\nAll three are considered resources for the purposes of ESI triage ratings. The resources tend to be used for more acute patients, require significant ED staff time, and likely lead to longer length of stay for patients.\\n\\n6. Are all asthmatics ESI level 4 because they will require a nebulized medication?\\n\\nNo. Stable asthmatics who only require a nebulized medications are assigned ESI level 4. However, some asthmatics are in severe respiratory distress and meet ESI level-2 criteria. Others are somewhere in between and will require intravenous steroids or an x-ray in addition to nebulized treatments and would be assigned ESI level 3. Finally, asthmatics who require only a prescription refill of their inhaler are assigned ESI level 5. They do not require any resources.\\n\\n##### Chapter 6.\\n\\n###### Frequently Asked Questions\\n\\n1. Why aren’t vital signs required to triage ESI level1 and 2 patients?\\n\\nVital signs are not necessary to rate patients as life threatening (ESI level 1) or high-risk (ESI level 2). Since ESI level 1 and 2 patients are critical, they require the medical team to respond quickly. Simultaneous actions can occur and vital signs can be collected as part of the initial assessment in the main acute area of the emergency department.\\n\\n2. Why aren’t vital signs required for ESI level-4 and 5 patients?\\n\\nVital signs are not necessary to rate patients as low or no resource (ESI level 4 or 5). Also, the pain, anxiety, and discomfort associated with an emergency department visit often alter a patient’s vital signs. Vital signs may quickly return to normal once the initial assessment is addressed. However, a nurse may choose to assess vital signs if signs of deranged symptoms exist (e.g., changes in skin color, mentation, dizziness, sweating). If there is no physical sign indicating a need for vital signs, the patient can be taken in the main emergency department or express care room.\\n\\n3. Why are vital signs done on ESI level-3 patients?\\n\\nVital signs can aid in differentiating patients needing multiple resources as either stable (ESI level 3) or potentially unstable or high-risk (ESI level 2). On occasion, ESI level-3 patients may actually have unstable vital signs while appearing stable. Vital signs for ESI level-3 patients provide a safety check. In general, ESI level-3 patients are more complicated and many are admitted to the hospital. Since these patients are not appropriate for the fast-track area, they are sometimes asked to wait for more definitive care. These patients present a unique challenge to the triaging process and caregivers find it necessary to rely on vital signs to confirm that an appropriate ESI level has been assigned.\\n\\n4. Why are temperatures always done for pediatric patients less than 36 months?\\n\\nTemperature is useful in differentiating pediatric patients that are low or no resource (ESI level 4 or 5) from those that will consume multiple resources. An abnormal temperature in the less than 3 month old may indicate bacteremia, and place the child in a high-risk category.\\n\\n5. Why does the literature present conflicting information on the value of vital signs during the triage process?\\n\\nThere is no definitive research on the utility of vital signs for emergency department triage. Many factors influence the accuracy of vital sign data. Vital signs are a somewhat operatordependent component of a patient’s assessment. In some cases, vital signs may be affected by many factors such as chronic drug therapy (e.g., beta-blockers). Vital signs may also be used to fulfill part of the public health obligation assumed by emergency departments. And, lastly, vital signs help segment young pediatric patients into various categories.\\n\\n6. Does JCAHO require vital signs to be done during triage?\\n\\nThe Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations does not specifically state a standard for vital signs. The organization does assert that physiologic parameters should be assessed as determined by patient condition.\\n\\n7. Should vital sign criteria be strict in the danger zone vital sign box?\\n\\nIn common usage, when the danger zone vital sign criteria are exceeded, up-triage is “considered” rather than automatic. The experienced triage nurse is called upon to use good clinical judgment in rating the patient’s ESI level. The nurse incorporates information about the vital signs, history, medications, and clinical presentation of the patient in that decisionmaking process. Research is still needed to determine the predictive value of vital signs at triage, and to determine absolute cutoffs for uptriage.\\n\\n8. What if ESI level-4 or 5 patients have danger zone vital signs?\\n\\nThough it is not required to take vital signs in order to assign ESI 4 or 5 levels, many patients may have vitals assessed at triage if that is part of the particular ED’s operational process. Per the ESI triage algorithm, the triage nurse does not have to take the vital signs into account in determining that the patient meets ESI level-5 (no resources) or ESI level-4 (one resource) criteria. However, in practice, the prudent nurse will use good clinical judgment and take the vital sign information into account in rating the ESI level. If the patient requests only a prescription refill and has no acute complaints, but has a heart rate of 104 after walking up the hill to the ED, the nurse might still rate the patient as an ESI level 5. But if the patient requests a prescription refill and has a heart rate of 148 and irregular, the nurse should rate the patient as ESI level 2. The triage nurse must also consider the following dilemma: an elevated blood pressure in an ESI level-4 or 5 patient. If the patient is asymptomatic related to the blood pressure, the triage level should not change. Most likely, an elevated BP in the asymptomatic patient will not be treated in the ED. However, it may be important to refer the patient to a primary care physician for BP follow-up and long term diagnosis and treatment.\"\n",

This manual covers all details of the Emergency_ Severity Index (ESI)—a five-level emergency department triage algorithm that provides clinically relevant stratification of patients into five groups from 1 (most urgent) to 5 (least urgent) on the basis of acuity and resource needs.\\n\\nAfter emergency physicians Richard Wuerz and David Eitel developed the ESI in 1998 and pilot testing yielded favorable results, the ESI Triage Group was formed. Further work on the initial development of ESI was carried out under an AHRQ grant. The ESI Triage Group, which consisted of medical clinicians, managers, educators, and researchers, further refined the algorithm to what it is today.\\n\\nIn keeping with our mission to improve the quality, safety, efficiency, and effectiveness of health care for all Americans, one of AHRQ's areas of emphasis is training. Along with the accompanying set of two DVDs, this handbook will provide invaluable assistance to emergency department nurses, physicians, and administrators in the implementation of a comprehensive ESI educational program. These materials are based on ESI Version 4, which updates the algorithm with a particular emphasis on the expansion of ESI level 1 criteria and refinement of the pediatric fever criteria.\\n\\nA well-implemented ESI program will help hospital emergency departments rapidly identify patients in need of immediate attention, better identify patients who could safely and more efficiently be seen in a fast-track or urgent care center rather than the main ED, and more accurately determine thresholds for diversion of ambulance patients from the ED.\\n\\nWe hope that you find this tool useful in your ongoing efforts to improve the quality of care provided by your emergency department.\\n\\n### Chapter 2.Triage Acuity Systems\\n\\n##### Standardization of Triage Acuity\\n\\nAlthough there are more than 110 million visits to U.S. emergency departments (EDs) each year (McCaig & Burt, 2004) there are very little aggregate data about those visits on the local, regional or national level. It is difficult to answer important questions such as “Which EDs see the sickest patients?” and “How does patient acuity affect ED overcrowding?” There is growing interest in the establishment of standards for ED data in the United States to support clinical care, ED surveillance, benchmarking, and research activities (Barthell, Coonan, Finnell, Pollock, & Cochrane, 2004; Gilboy, Travers & Wuerz, 1999; Handler et al., 2004; National Center for Injury Prevention and Control\\n\\n[NCIPC], 1997; Zimmermann, 2001).

The chapter concludes with a review of the research on the new ESI triage system and discusses the potential benefits of the ESI.\\n\\n##### Triage Systems in the United States\\n\\nThough many U.S. hospitals still use a three- or fourlevel triage system, the trend is toward the use of five-level systems. The National Center for Health Statistics plans to replace four-level triage data with five-level triage data in future national benchmarking surveys of U.S. EDs.\"}"
