# Emergency Severity Index, Version 4: Implementation Handbook

### Note from the Director

The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality is proud to present the Emergency Severity Index, Version 4: Implementation Handbook. This guide details every aspect of the Emergency Severity Index (ESI), a five-level triage system used in emergency departments to categorize patients into five groups—ranging from 1 (most urgent) to 5 (least urgent)—based on the severity of their condition and the resources they require.

Following the creation of the ESI by emergency physicians Richard Wuerz and David Eitel in 1998 and successful pilot testing, the ESI Triage Group was established. Additional development of the ESI was supported by a grant from AHRQ. This group, made up of clinicians, managers, educators, and researchers, continued to improve the algorithm into its current form.

Aligned with our mission to enhance the quality, safety, efficiency, and effectiveness of health care for all Americans, AHRQ places a strong focus on training. This handbook, together with the included two DVDs, offers essential support to emergency department nurses, physicians, and administrators in establishing a thorough ESI educational program. The resources are based on ESI Version 4, which features updates to the algorithm, particularly expanding the criteria for ESI level 1 and refining the guidelines for pediatric fever.

An effectively executed ESI program enables hospital emergency departments to quickly recognize patients requiring urgent care, more accurately identify those who can be safely and efficiently treated in a fast-track or urgent care setting instead of the main ED, and more precisely establish criteria for diverting ambulance patients away from the ED.

We hope this tool proves helpful as you continue working to enhance the quality of care in your emergency department.

### Chapter 2.Triage Acuity Systems

##### Standardization of Triage Acuity

Despite the fact that U.S. emergency departments (EDs) receive over 110 million visits annually (McCaig & Burt, 2004), there is a lack of comprehensive data on these visits at the local, regional, or national scale. This scarcity of information makes it challenging to address key questions such as “Which EDs treat the most critically ill patients?” and “What impact does patient acuity have on ED overcrowding?” As a result, there is increasing interest in developing standardized ED data systems in the United States to enhance clinical care, facilitate ED monitoring, enable benchmarking, and support research efforts (Barthell, Coonan, Finnell, Pollock, & Cochrane, 2004; Gilboy, Travers & Wuerz, 1999; Handler et al., 2004; National Center for Injury Prevention and Control).

A key data point in the emergency department is triage acuity, described by the Data Elements for Emergency Department Systems Task Force as the categorization of a patient’s condition based on how life- or limb-threatening it is, and whether urgent intervention is required to relieve symptoms (NCIPC, 1997, p. 94).

There is significant inconsistency among emergency department triage acuity systems, especially within the United States (Emergency Nurses Association [ENA], 1997). Different systems use varying terminology for triage categories, and there is no universal consensus on the definitions for each level. Table 2-1 provides examples of acuity rating systems. Due to the absence of standardized triage acuity data in the U.S., it is understandable that the emergency department has been referred to as a “black box” of crucial public health information that remains mostly inaccessible in its current state (Martinez, 1995).

The Emergency Severity Index (ESI) is an innovative tool for assessing triage acuity in emergency departments. Research has demonstrated its consistency across various ED environments, including both urban and rural areas as well as academic and community hospitals (Eitel, Travers, Rosenau, Gilboy & Wuerz, 2003). With widespread adoption in U.S. emergency departments, the ESI could serve as a standard method for triage acuity assessment. This chapter outlines the traditional triage systems used in U.S. EDs and reviews the research related to those systems. It then provides a brief overview of recent triage approaches developed in Australia, Canada, and the United Kingdom. The chapter ends with an examination of studies on the new ESI triage system and explores its potential advantages.

##### Triage Systems in the United States

Although numerous hospitals in the United States continue to utilize three- or four-level triage systems, there is a movement toward adopting five-level systems. The National Center for Health Statistics intends to substitute four-level triage data with five-level data in upcoming national benchmarking surveys of U.S. emergency departments. This change is driven by increasing evidence that five-level triage acuity data are more reliable and valid compared to three-level systems (personal communication, Linda McCaig, National Center for Health Statistics, October 6, 2004).

Both the ENA and the American College of Emergency Physicians (ACEP) have expressed their support for five-level triage systems in U.S. emergency departments. In 2003, a joint task force from ENA and ACEP was formed to review the evidence regarding five-level triage systems, and their work is still in progress. That same year, ACEP and ENA released a joint statement:

ACEP and ENA believe that patient care quality would improve by introducing a standardized triage scale and acuity classification system in emergency departments. Drawing on expert consensus and current evidence, ACEP and ENA endorse the use of a dependable, validated five-level triage scale (ACEP, 2003; ENA, 2003).

A 2005 task force paper recommended both the ESI and the Canadian Triage and Acuity Scale (CTAS) as reliable and valid triage methods (Fernandes et al., 2005). With increasing evidence favoring five-level triage systems, it is probable that a greater number of U.S. hospitals have adopted some version of this approach. The ENA intends to gather information on the types of triage systems used in U.S. hospitals in their next emergency department survey.

##### Research on Triage Systems in the United States

Research on triage acuity systems is increasing, with a primary focus on two important aspects of triage nurses’ acuity ratings: reliability and validity (Pedhazur & Schmelkin, 1991; Waltz, Strickland & Lenz, 1991). Reliability refers to the consistency or level of agreement among individuals using a particular rating system. In the context of emergency department (ED) triage acuity ratings, there are two relevant types of reliability. Interrater reliability assesses whether two different nurses would assign the same triage acuity level to the same patient, while intrarater reliability examines if the same nurse would give the same rating to the same patient at different times. Multiple studies in the United States have found that traditional three-level triage systems often show low interrater and intrarater reliability (Gill, Reese & Diamond, 1996; Travers, Waller, Bowling, Flowers & Tintinalli, 2002; Wuerz, Fernandes & Alarcon, 1998). In one such study, 305 triage assessments were analyzed after all triage nurses completed a required refresher course on the hospital’s three-level triage system (Travers et al., 2002). The initial ratings by the triage nurses were compared to retrospective ratings made by an expert panel of ED triage nurses, and the two groups agreed in about half of the cases.

Validity refers to how accurately the rating system measures what it is supposed to measure. In the context of acuity ratings, validity indicates whether a label such as “nonurgent” truly reflects the absence of urgency in an emergency department patient’s condition. Assessing the validity of triage acuity has been challenging, and research studies have not reported on it.

In contrast to urine culture—which serves as the gold standard for accurately diagnosing urinary tract infections—there is no definitive gold standard for assessing the accuracy of triage acuity ratings in the conventional three-level triage system used in the United States. Instead, surrogate indicators such as admission rates, resource use, and six-month mortality have been employed to evaluate the effectiveness of five-level triage systems.

##### Triage Acuity Research on Five- Level Systems Abroad

Highly reliable and well-established five-level triage systems are now standard practice in various countries. Table 2-2 outlines three of these systems.

The Australasian Triage Scale (ATS), created in Australia, has been implemented across Australia and New Zealand since the early 1990s (Australasian College for Emergency Medicine, 1994, 2002; Cameron, Bradt & Ashby, 1996). The Australian Council on Healthcare Standards uses the ATS as the foundation for emergency department (ED) evaluation and quality assurance, with triage classifications regularly reviewed. Australian EDs are required to manage patients according to guidelines determined by their triage level. For instance, emergency cases must be attended to within 10 minutes, while nonurgent cases should be seen within 2 hours.

Several studies have assessed the validity and reliability of the ATS. Since there is no definitive gold standard for evaluating triage acuity, researchers have compared the five-level system to other illness severity scales and patient outcomes (Cameron et al., 1996; Cleary, Ashby, Jelinek & Lagaida, 1994; Erwich, Bond, Phillips, & Baggoley, 1997). Triage categories have shown strong correlations with disease- and population-specific measures, such as the Injury Severity Scales, trauma scores, and scales for cardiac, asthma, and pediatric patients. The ATS has also demonstrated a strong relationship with resource use and outcome indicators, including admission rates, emergency department length of stay, and mortality. Additionally, studies in which triage nurses assigned acuity levels to case scenarios have found that the ATS exhibits fair to moderate interrater reliability (Dilley & Standen, 1998; Jelinek & Little, 1996).

Five-level triage systems have been adopted in both the United Kingdom (U.K.) and Canada. In the U.K., the Manchester Triage Scale is utilized.

The system, developed in the U.K., uses a flow-chart presentation style (Manchester Triage Group, 1997). Nurses begin by determining the patient's main complaint, then select one of 52 flow charts to guide a structured interview and assign a triage category ranging from 1 (requiring immediate attention) to 5 (care needed within four hours). The Accident and Emergency Nurses Association has endorsed this system (Zimmermann, 2001). However, research on the Manchester system is limited. In one reliability study, triage assessments by nurses were retrospectively compared to those of senior medical staff, with only fair to moderate agreement found (Goodacre, Gillett, Harris & Houlihan, 1999).

The Canadian Triage and Acuity Scale (CTAS) was created by a team of Canadian emergency physicians (Beveridge & Ducharme, 1997; Canadian Association for Emergency Physicians [CAEP], 2002). Both the National Emergency Nurses' Affiliation, Inc. (NENA) and the Canadian Association for Emergency Physicians (CAEP) have recognized CTAS as the national benchmark for emergency department triage. Canadian hospitals are mandated to report data, including CTAS scores, for all emergency department visits to the Canadian government. Research has also demonstrated that the Canadian five-level scale provides strong interrater reliability when clinicians assess the severity of written scenarios based on real patient cases.

##### History of the Emergency Severity Index (ESI)

The Emergency Severity Index (ESI) is a five-level triage system created by emergency department physicians Richard Wuerz and David Eitel in the United States (Gilboy et al., 1999; Wuerz, Milne, Eitel, Travers & Gilboy, 2000). The creators believed that a key function of an emergency department triage tool is to help prioritize patients according to the urgency of their conditions. Triage nurses assess priority by asking, “Who should be seen first?” However, Drs. Wuerz and Eitel recognized that when several high-priority patients arrive at the same time, the question shifts to, “How long can each patient wait?” The ESI was designed based on a new approach to ED triage. Beyond determining which patient needs immediate attention, the ESI also guides triage nurses in considering what resources are required to move each patient toward an ED outcome. While the ESI maintains the traditional focus on patient urgency, it also aims to achieve a second objective: not only sorting patients but also directing them to the appropriate resources, ensuring the right patient receives the right care at the right time and place.

The initial version (v. 1) of the ESI was first used at two university-affiliated emergency departments in the spring of 1999. By fall 2000, the ESI was updated with input from emergency department clinicians to add triage criteria for pediatric patients, and this second version (v. 2) was then introduced in five more hospitals, including both non-university teaching and community hospitals. Drawing on feedback from nurses and physicians at these locations, as well as the best scientific evidence available, the ESI was further improved and released as version 3 (v. 3) in 2001 (Wuerz et al., 2001). More recently, additional updates have been made to the tool, which is presented in this edition of the ESI handbook as version 4 (v. 4) (Tanabe et al., in press).

Emergency physicians and nurses in the United States and Canada have carried out multiple research studies evaluating the reliability and validity of the ESI. The ESI has been directly compared with traditional three-level triage systems as well as the five-level CTAS. These studies will be discussed later in the chapter. Similar to the Australasian, Canadian, and U.K. systems, the ESI triage system consists of five levels. However, it differs in both its conceptual framework and practical use. The triage systems from Australia, Canada, and the U.K. are based on the idea that triage is meant to determine how long a patient can safely wait for care in the emergency department, with specific definitions for the time to physician assessment included in their protocols. This is a key distinction between ESI and both CTAS and the ATS, as ESI does not specify expected time frames for physician evaluation.

The ESI stands out because it requires the triage nurse to predict the resources a patient will need—such as diagnostic tests and procedures—in addition to assessing acuity, in order to assign a triage category for patients who are less critically ill. Figure 2-1 presents the ESI triage levels. Later chapters will explain in detail how to use the ESI to categorize emergency department patients. In summary, the process begins with evaluating acuity by considering the stability of the patient’s vital signs and the risk of an immediate threat to life or organs. For patients who are stable, the nurse then estimates the resources likely needed to reach a disposition in the emergency department, based on their professional judgment. These resource requirements can vary from none to two or more.

##### Research on the Emergency Severity Index

In a preliminary study evaluating ESI v.1 ratings for 493 triage cases at two Boston hospitals in 1998, researchers determined that the system was both valid and reliable (Wuerz et al., 2000). During the study, patients were triaged at the same time by the triage nurse using the standard three-level scale and by a research nurse applying the first version of the ESI. Afterwards, an investigator, who was unaware of the research nurse’s ESI rating, reassessed the patients using only the written triage notes and the ESI. The triage levels showed a strong correlation with the resources utilized in the emergency department and with outcomes like hospital admission. Patients with higher acuity (ESI levels 1 and 2) required more resources and had a greater likelihood of being admitted compared to those with lower acuity (ESI levels 4 and 5). The agreement between the research nurse and the investigator was high, with 77 percent matching exactly and 22 percent differing by only one triage level.

Several studies have assessed the reliability of the ESI by using the kappa statistic to determine inter-rater agreement, where kappa values range from 0 (no agreement) to 1 (perfect agreement). At one of the original ESI sites, a time series design was employed to compare triage reliability using a three-level scale before and after the introduction of ESI v.1 (Travers et al., 2002). The reliability improved, with the weighted kappa increasing from 0.53 for the three-level system to 0.68 for the five-level ESI. Another study investigated the reliability and validity of ESI v.2 during and after its implementation in triage at seven hospitals in the northeast and southeast. Over 200 triage nurses participated in an ESI triage education program, where they rated 40 case studies using the ESI (Eitel et al., 2003). The findings showed substantial inter-rater reliability, with kappa values between 0.70 and 0.80. Additionally, 386 actual patient triage decisions were analyzed, revealing high inter-rater reliability with weighted kappas from 0.69 to 0.87. In a separate study conducted at an urban emergency department in the Midwest, researchers assessed the reliability of ESI v.3 for 403 real patient triages and found a kappa of 0.89 (Tanabe, Gimbel, Yarnold, Kyriacou & Adams, 2004).

Researchers from Canada and the United States have directly compared the inter-rater reliability of the ESI and CTAS in a randomized study (Worster et al., 2004). The study involved ten Canadian triage nurses who were experienced with CTAS. These nurses were randomly assigned to receive either ESI version 3 or CTAS refresher training, after which they evaluated 200 case studies using either the ESI or CTAS. Both groups demonstrated excellent inter-rater reliability, with kappa values of 0.89 for ESI and 0.91 for CTAS.

The effectiveness of the ESI has been assessed by analyzing outcomes in several thousand patients. Research has demonstrated consistent and strong associations between the ESI and factors such as hospitalization, emergency department length of stay, and mortality (Eitel et al., 2003; Tanabe et al., 2004; Wuerz, 2001; Wuerz et al., 2001). Additionally, the ESI has shown moderate correlations with physician evaluation and management codes, as well as nursing workload indicators (Travers et al., 2002). The ESI also enables meaningful comparisons of patient case mix across different hospitals. In one study, a stratified random sample of 200 patients was taken from each of the seven original ESI hospitals to compare case mix (Eitel et al., 2003). As anticipated, tertiary care centers had a greater proportion of high-acuity patients, while community hospitals had more patients requiring fewer resources.

A survey conducted among nursing staff at the two initial university teaching hospitals found that the response to the ESI implementation was favorable (Wuerz et al., 2001). Nurses indicated that the ESI was simpler to use and more effective for prioritizing patients for care compared to the previous three-level systems used at both locations.

In the latest ESI study, the accuracy of ESI level 2 was closely analyzed (Tanabe et al., in press). Among 571 patients categorized as ESI level 2 across five hospitals, 20 percent required immediate, life-saving treatment. The researchers suggested that these patients should be reclassified as ESI level 1. The revised ESI version 4, discussed in subsequent chapters of this book, incorporates changes informed by this recent research.

##### Benefits of the Emergency Severity Index

The ESI has been adopted by hospitals across various regions, including both university and community hospitals, as well as teaching and nonteaching facilities. Clinicians, managers, and researchers in these settings have recognized several advantages of ESI triage compared to traditional three-level systems. One key advantage is the ability to quickly identify patients who require immediate care. ESI triage emphasizes the efficient sorting of patients, especially when resources are limited. In some ways, it returns to the original intent of triage as established during Napoleon’s era. ESI sorts patients into five categories, each with significant differences in anticipated resource needs and corresponding operational requirements. This rapid categorization can enhance patient flow through the emergency department. After an ESI level is determined, patients can be directed to further assessment, registration, initial treatment, or the waiting area, depending on their severity and expected resource use. For instance, patients classified as level 1 or 2 are taken straight to the treatment area for prompt evaluation and care, while those at levels 4 and 5 proceed to registration and then wait for an available bed.

A key concern separate from ESI triage is when to perform a full nursing assessment. Many experts agree that a comprehensive assessment does not need to take place at the initial triage station; instead, it can be completed in the main treatment area or a secondary triage area, depending on each patient’s needs and the current workload in the emergency department (Gilboy et al., 1999). At triage, only the evaluation necessary to assign an ESI level is required to help with the initial sorting of patients. Full clinical assessments are time-consuming, and conducting them at triage can delay care and lower satisfaction for patients with less severe conditions. As patient numbers and case complexity rise, leading to ED overcrowding, it is necessary to rethink traditional care processes to improve efficiency and effectiveness. Nevertheless, it remains essential to gather enough information to accurately determine the appropriate triage category. This is particularly important when patients face long waits to see a physician, which is common with higher patient volumes. Triage has become even more vital as waiting room times increase. Assigning a patient to an inappropriately low triage category can heighten the risk of poor outcomes due to the resulting extended wait.

Additional advantages of the ESI include its ability to identify patients who do not require care in the main emergency department and can instead be safely and more efficiently managed in a fast-track or urgent care setting. For instance, in many hospitals, triage guidelines specify that all ESI level 4 and 5 patients may be directed to either medical urgent care or minor trauma sections of the ED. The policy also permits certain level-3 patients, such as those needing straightforward migraine treatment, to be sent to urgent care (UC). ESI level-3 patients assigned to UC, as well as any patients transferred from UC to the acute area for more serious issues, are tracked through the quality improvement program. Nurses using the ESI have noted that it improves communication about patient acuity compared to the previous three-level triage systems used at these facilities (Wuerz et al., 2001). For example, a triage nurse can say to the charge nurse, “I need a bed for a level 2 patient,” and this shared terminology allows the charge nurse to immediately understand the situation without requiring a detailed patient description.

The ESI has also served as the basis for emergency department policies targeting certain groups. For instance, at one location, the psychiatric team is required to provide consultations for level 2 and 3 patients within 30 minutes, and for level 4 and 5 patients within an hour of being notified. At another facility, the ESI is part of a policy for patients over 20 weeks pregnant who come to the ED. Patients assigned ESI levels 1 and 2 receive care in the ED by emergency medicine staff with an obstetric consultation, while those at levels 3, 4, or 5 are directed to the hospital’s labor and delivery unit.

The ESI is also an effective method for setting thresholds to divert ambulance patients away from the ED. At Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston, the ED Diversion Policy and Guidelines define full capacity as all RN-staffed ED beds being occupied. The ESI is utilized to assess when the department is over capacity.

Studies have demonstrated that the ESI is a dependable and accurate method for assessing triage acuity. This system has been implemented in numerous emergency departments across various regions of the United States, including both academic and community hospitals. These institutions have shown that using the ESI enhances emergency department efficiency and patient outcomes. Broader use of the ESI in U.S. hospitals could help create a standardized approach to triage acuity assessment, supporting benchmarking, public health monitoring, and research efforts.

### Chapter 3. Introduction to the Emergency Severity Index

The Emergency Severity Index (ESI) is an easy-to-use, five-level triage tool that classifies emergency department patients by assessing both the severity of their condition and the resources they will require. The triage nurse first evaluates the patient’s acuity. If the patient does not qualify for the highest acuity levels (ESI level 1 or 2), the nurse then considers the anticipated resource needs to assign a triage level (ESI level 3, 4, or 5). Unlike other triage systems, the ESI uniquely incorporates resource requirements into its assessment. Acuity is judged based on the stability of vital signs and the risk to life, limb, or organ function. The nurse predicts resource needs by drawing on experience with patients who have had similar symptoms or injuries. Resource needs refer to the number of interventions or services a patient is likely to need before a decision about their care can be made. After becoming familiar with the ESI algorithm, the triage nurse can quickly and accurately assign patients to one of five clearly defined, non-overlapping categories. The ESI offers emergency departments a reliable and valid method for triage (Eitel, Travers, Rosenau, Gilboy & Wuerz, 2003; Travers, Waller, Bowling, Flowers & Tintinalli, 2002; Wuerz, Travers, Gilboy, Eitel, Rosenau & Yazhari, 2001; Tanabe, Gimbel, Yarnold, Kyriacou, & Adams, 2004; Tanabe, Gimbel, Yarnold, & Adams, 2004).

This chapter offers a detailed, step-by-step guide to triaging using the ESI algorithm. Later chapters delve deeper into essential concepts and include various examples to illustrate the nuances of applying ESI.

Algorithms are commonly applied in emergency care settings. Many emergency clinicians are well-acquainted with the algorithms taught in programs like Basic Life Support, Advanced Cardiac Life Support, and the Trauma Nursing Core Course. These programs offer a systematic, stepwise method for clinical decision making that clinicians can master through repeated practice. At each stage of the algorithm, users are guided on which questions to pose or what information to collect. Depending on the responses or data gathered, a decision is reached, and the algorithm leads the user to the subsequent step, eventually resulting in an outcome.

Using the ESI algorithm for triage requires an experienced emergency department nurse to begin at the top of the algorithm. Figure 3-1 provides a conceptual summary of the ESI algorithm, highlighting its key decision points. A more detailed explanation of the actual ESI algorithm is given later in the chapter (see Figure 3-1a). The algorithm involves four decision points (A, B, C, and D) to categorize patients into one of five triage levels (refer to Figure 3-1). With experience, the triage nurse will be able to quickly progress through each ESI decision point.

##### Decision Point A: Is the Patient Dying?

In simple terms, at decision point A (Figure 3-2), the triage nurse determines whether the patient is dying. If the response is “yes,” the triage process ends, and the patient is immediately assigned to ESI level 1. If the answer is “no,” the process continues to the next step in the algorithm, decision point B.

This question helps assess if the patient is at risk of imminent death (conceptual algorithm): Does the patient need urgent life-saving measures? The questions below assist in evaluating whether the patient fulfills level-1 criteria:

Does the patient need urgent airway management, medication, or another hemodynamic intervention?

Does the patient exhibit any of the following: is already intubated, not breathing, without a pulse, experiencing severe respiratory distress, has an SpO2 below 90 percent, shows sudden changes in mental status, or is unresponsive?

Studies have shown that triage nurses can reliably anticipate when immediate interventions are necessary (Tanabe et al., in press). For ESI triage, Table 3-1 outlines which interventions are classified as life-saving and which are not.

Interventions that are not classified as life-saving may involve diagnostic or therapeutic procedures, but do not directly “save a life.” Life-saving interventions focus on ensuring an open airway, sustaining breathing, or supporting circulation. The following questions may assist in assessing whether a patient needs a life-saving intervention.

Is this patient's airway open and unobstructed?

Is the patient showing signs of breathing?

Is the patient exhibiting a pulse?

Is the nurse worried about the pulse’s rate, rhythm, and strength?

Was this patient intubated before arriving at the hospital due to worries about their capacity to keep their airway open, breathe on their own, or sustain adequate oxygen levels?

Is the nurse worried about whether this patient can supply enough oxygen to their tissues?

An ESI level-1 patient arrives at the emergency department in a critical, unstable state. Immediate intervention is essential to prevent death, prompting a coordinated team response with the physician present at the bedside and nurses delivering intensive care. These patients receive immediate attention, as prompt treatment can influence their risk of complications or death.

A primary distinction between ESI level-1 and level-2 patients is the necessity for immediate physician involvement in patient care. Level-1 patients are in critical condition and need prompt evaluation and intervention by a physician. In contrast, although level-2 patients are also seriously ill, emergency nurses can begin treatment using established protocols without a physician present. The nurse understands that interventions are required but is assured that the patient’s condition is stable enough not to worsen rapidly. The nurse can start intravenous lines, provide supplemental oxygen, perform an ECG, and connect the patient to a cardiac monitor before a physician is required at the bedside.

When assessing the necessity for urgent lifesaving measures, the triage nurse thoroughly examines the patient’s respiratory condition and oxygen saturation (SpO2) levels. Even if a patient is still breathing, severe respiratory distress or an SpO2 below 90 percent signals the need for prompt action to secure the airway and ensure adequate oxygenation. Such a patient will need the physician present to administer medications for rapid sequence intubation or to initiate other airway and breathing interventions.

Patients experiencing chest pain should also be assessed according to the same standards. Some individuals with chest pain are quite stable and may only need a diagnostic ECG, meaning they do not qualify for level-1 criteria. In contrast, those who appear pale, sweaty, in severe respiratory distress, or are hemodynamically unstable will need urgent, life-saving treatment and do fulfill level-1 criteria. Every patient with chest pain must be evaluated against the level-1 criteria to decide if immediate life-saving intervention is necessary.

When deciding if a patient needs immediate life-saving care, the triage nurse must evaluate the patient’s level of consciousness. The ESI algorithm utilizes the AVPU scale (alert, verbal, pain, unresponsive) as shown in Table 3-2. This step aims to identify patients experiencing a sudden change in consciousness. The nurse should look for deviations from the patient’s baseline, with particular concern for those who were previously alert but are now categorized as P (pain) or U (unresponsive). Unresponsiveness should be considered in the context of sudden neurological changes, and not in patients with pre-existing developmental delays, documented dementia, or aphasia. Any patient who is unresponsive—including those who are intoxicated and do not respond to painful stimuli—meets level-1 criteria and requires immediate assessment. For instance, a patient with a sudden decrease in mental status who cannot maintain their airway or is in severe respiratory distress would need urgent intervention.

Users familiar with ESI version 3 (v. 3) will observe a significant modification in the ESI level-1 criteria. The primary distinction between ESI v. 3 and ESI version 4 (v. 4) is the recognition and reclassification of some of the most critically ill patients, who were previously categorized as ESI level 2. Now, patients who need immediate life-saving interventions are assigned to ESI level 1. In the earlier version, a patient experiencing severe respiratory distress who needed intubation but was still breathing would have been placed in ESI level 2. Under the current version, this patient now qualifies for level 1. Additional examples of patients now considered ESI level 1 include those who are weak and dizzy with a heart rate of 30 or 200. While this adjustment may not impact a large number of patients, it ensures that the most critically ill are classified correctly. Before v. 4, triage nurses often faced two types of ESI level-2 patients: those needing immediate attention and those who could safely wait a short period (about 10 minutes) without worsening. This issue prompted a large, multi-center, prospective study to determine which ESI level-2 patients actually received immediate interventions (Tanabe et al., in press). Findings from that study led to the revision of the ESI system. This updated ESI handbook outlines these changes and introduces ESI v. 4.

An ESI level-1 patient does not necessarily arrive at the emergency department by ambulance. Individuals with drug overdoses or acute alcohol intoxication might be left at the entrance, while children could be brought in by car and carried inside. An experienced triage nurse can quickly recognize these critically ill patients. With a swift, visual assessment from a distance, the nurse identifies those in severe distress. These patients are promptly moved to the treatment area, where resuscitation begins immediately.

Patients classified as ESI level 1 make up about 1 to 3 percent of all emergency department cases (Eitel et al., 2003; Wuerz, Milne, Eitel, Travers & Gilboy, 2000; Wuerz et al., 2001). These patients require immediate resuscitation by either the emergency physician and nurse or the trauma or code team upon arrival. Research on ESI indicates that the majority of ESI level-1 patients are admitted to intensive care units, while some do not survive their time in the emergency department (Eitel et al., 2003; Wuerz, 2001). A small number of ESI level-1 patients are discharged from the ED if their altered level of consciousness or vital functions—such as those caused by hypoglycemia, seizures, alcohol intoxication, or anaphylaxis—are reversible.

Illustrations of ESI level 1:

Heart stoppage.

Cessation of breathing.

Acute difficulty breathing.

Oxygen saturation below 90%.

Severely injured trauma patient arriving in an unresponsive state.

Overdose presenting with a respiratory rate of 6.

Three general questions are utilized to assess if the patient satisfies level-2 criteria.

Is this considered a high-risk scenario?

2. Does the patient exhibit confusion, lethargy, or disorientation?

3. Is the patient experiencing significant pain or discomfort?

The triage nurse gathers relevant subjective and objective data to promptly address these questions. This section provides a concise overview of ESI level-2 criteria, with a more comprehensive discussion of patients qualifying for ESI level-2 to be covered in Chapter 4.

Severe breathing difficulty accompanied by agonal or gasping respirations.

Markedly slow or fast heart rate accompanied by evidence of inadequate tissue perfusion.

Low blood pressure accompanied by indications of inadequate tissue perfusion.

A trauma patient in need of urgent resuscitation with crystalloids and colloids.

Experiencing chest pain, appearing pale and sweaty, with a blood pressure of 70 by palpation.

Feeling faint and lightheaded, heart rate is 30.

Severe allergic response.

Infant exhibiting limpness.

Unconscious with a strong smell of alcohol.

Low blood sugar accompanied by altered mental state.

##### Decision Point B: Should the Patient Wait?

After the triage nurse establishes that the patient does not qualify for ESI level 1, they proceed to decision point B (refer to Figure 33). At this stage, the nurse must determine if the patient can safely wait to be evaluated. If waiting is not appropriate, the patient is assigned ESI level 2. If the patient can wait, the process continues to the following step in the algorithm.

###### Is This a High-risk Situation?

Drawing on a brief patient interview, general observations, and the intuition developed through experience, the triage nurse identifies patients at high risk. Often, factors such as the patient’s age and medical history play a role in this assessment. A high-risk patient is someone whose condition could quickly worsen or who shows symptoms indicating a need for urgent, time-sensitive care. This type of patient may face a significant threat to life or organ function. In most cases, a comprehensive physical exam or a complete set of vital signs is not necessary to recognize high risk. Instead, the patient may describe symptoms that an experienced triage nurse immediately recognizes as concerning. For instance, a patient who says, “I never get headaches and after lifting something heavy, I now have the worst headache of my life,” would be triaged as ESI level 2, as these symptoms could indicate a subarachnoid hemorrhage.

If a patient is classified as ESI level 2, the triage nurse has determined that it is not safe for them to wait in the waiting area for any period of time. Although ESI guidelines do not specify exact time frames, patients at ESI level 2 are a high priority and should typically be placed and begin receiving treatment within 10 minutes of their arrival. It is crucial to note that even though the criteria for level 1 have broadened in version 4 of the algorithm, ESI level 2 patients are still regarded as very ill and at significant risk. Immediate care is necessary, and a suitable bed must be located right away. In most cases, instead of proceeding to the next patient, the triage nurse recognizes the severity of the situation and promptly notifies the charge nurse or staff in the patient care area that an ESI level 2 patient requires urgent attention.

Instances of high-risk scenarios:

Experiencing ongoing chest pain suggestive of coronary syndrome, but currently stable and not in need of urgent life-saving treatment.

A healthcare worker experiencing a needlestick injury.

Shows symptoms of a stroke, but does not fulfill level-1 requirements.

Ectopic pregnancy has been ruled out; the patient is hemodynamically stable.

A patient undergoing chemotherapy, and thus immunosuppressed, presenting with a fever.

A patient exhibiting suicidal or homicidal tendencies.

Chapter 4 provides further details about high-risk situations.

###### Is the Patient Confused, Lethargic, or Disoriented?

This is the second question to consider at decision point B. Once more, the focus is on determining if the patient is showing a sudden change in consciousness. Patients who are normally confused do not qualify for level-2 criteria.

Confused: Shows unsuitable reactions to stimuli, with reduced attention span and impaired memory.

Lethargic: Sleepy, spends more time sleeping than normal, but reacts properly when prompted.

Disoriented: The patient cannot accurately respond to questions regarding time, location, or identity.

Instances of patients exhibiting confusion, lethargy, or disorientation:

Recent development of confusion in an older adult.

The mother reports that her 3-month-old baby is sleeping constantly.

The teenager was discovered in a state of confusion and disorientation.

All of these examples suggest that the brain could be impaired either in its structure or its chemistry.

###### Is This Patient in Severe Pain or Distress?

At decision point B, the triage nurse’s third question is whether the patient is experiencing pain or distress. If the answer is “no,” the nurse proceeds to the next step in the process. If the answer is “yes,” the nurse must evaluate the severity of the pain or distress, using clinical observation and/or a self-reported pain score of 7 or above on a 0 to 10 scale. When a patient reports pain at 7/10 or higher, the nurse may assign an ESI level 2, but this is not mandatory. Pain is a frequent reason for emergency department visits, and not all patients with pain scores of 7/10 or more require an ESI level-2 designation. For instance, a patient with a sprained ankle and pain rated at 8/10 would typically be classified as ESI level 4. Assigning a level 2 rating based solely on pain is not necessary in such cases.

In certain patients, pain can be evaluated through clinical observation, such as noting distressed facial expressions, sweating, body posture, and alterations in vital signs. The triage nurse looks for physical signs of acute pain that validate the patient’s reported pain level. For instance, a patient with abdominal pain who is sweating, has a rapid heart rate, and elevated blood pressure, or a patient experiencing severe flank pain accompanied by vomiting, pale skin, and a history of kidney stones, are both clear examples of individuals who qualify for ESI level-2. More details about ESI level 2 and pain assessment can be found in Chapter 4.

Severe distress may be either physical or mental. Instances of distress include a victim of sexual assault, an aggressive patient, or a person with bipolar disorder experiencing a manic episode.

ESI level-2 patients represent a relatively small but high-risk segment, making up 20 to 30 percent of emergency department visits (Travers et al., 2002; Wuerz et al., 2001; Tanabe, Gimbel et al., 2004). After identifying an ESI level-2 patient, the triage nurse must ensure prompt care. Registration may be handled by a family member or completed at the bedside. These patients require vital signs and a thorough nursing assessment, though this does not have to occur during triage. Patient placement should not be postponed to complete vital sign collection. Studies on ESI indicate that 50 to 60 percent of ESI level-2 patients are admitted from the emergency department (Wuerz et al., 2001).

##### Decision Point C: Resource Needs

If the responses to the first two decision points are “no,” the triage nurse proceeds to decision point C (refer to Figure 3-4). At this stage, the nurse should inquire, “How many different resources will this patient likely require for the physician to make a disposition decision?” Possible dispositions include discharging the patient home, admitting them to the observation unit or hospital, or transferring them to another facility. This step again calls for the triage nurse to rely on previous experience with similar emergency department cases. It is important for ED nurses to recognize that estimating resource needs is based on standards of care and is not influenced by the hospital’s type (teaching or non-teaching) or its location. Any patient arriving at an emergency department should generally utilize the same resources to reach a disposition. Taking into account the patient’s brief subjective and objective evaluation, medical history, allergies, medications, age, and gender, the nurse must determine how many different resources will be necessary for the physician to decide on a disposition. Essentially, what is the usual protocol for a patient presenting to the ED with this common complaint? The triage nurse should make this determination based on their assessment of the patient, focusing on standard practices in the specific ED rather than individual provider preferences.

To determine what resources are needed, the triage nurse should understand the standards of care in the emergency department. The nurse must also be aware of the idea of “prudent and customary.” An effective way to approach this is to consider, “Based on this patient’s main complaint or injury, what resources will the emergency physician probably use?” Resources may include hospital services, diagnostic tests, procedures, consultations, or interventions that go beyond the physician’s history and physical exam, as well as basic emergency department actions like applying a bandage. Additional details and examples can be found in Chapter 5.

Table 3-3 outlines what qualifies and does not qualify as a resource for ESI triage classification. Patients at ESI level 3 are expected to need two or more resources, those at ESI level 4 are anticipated to need one resource, and ESI level 5 patients are expected to need no resources, as shown in Table 3-4.

Studies indicate that ESI level-3 patients account for 30% to 40% of those treated in the emergency department (Eitel et al., 2003; Wuerz et al., 2001). These individuals typically need more comprehensive assessments but are considered stable in the short term, which can result in longer ED stays. ESI level 4 and 5 patients represent 20% to 35% of emergency department visits, and this percentage may be higher in areas with limited access to primary care. Properly trained mid-level providers with suitable skill sets could manage these patients in a fast-track or express care environment, especially since many present with trauma-related issues. Given their stable condition, it is safe for these patients to wait several hours before being seen.

##### Decision Point D:The Patient's Vital Signs

Prior to assigning a patient to ESI level 3, the nurse must review the patient’s vital signs to determine if they fall outside the normal range for the patient’s age and if these abnormalities are clinically significant. If the vital signs are abnormal, the triage nurse should consider elevating the triage level to ESI level 2. Ultimately, it is up to the triage nurse to decide whether the patient should be upgraded to ESI level 2 due to abnormal vital signs. This is referred to as decision point D.

Vital sign parameters vary by age (refer to Figure 3-5). The vital signs considered include pulse, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation, with body temperature also assessed in children under three years old. Based on these criteria, a triage nurse may decide to upgrade an adult patient with a heart rate of 104, or keep them at ESI level 3. Similarly, a 6-month-old infant with a cold and a respiratory rate of 48 might be assigned to ESI level 2 or 3. The nurse must determine, using the patient’s history and physical exam, whether the vital signs indicate a high enough risk that the patient should not wait to be evaluated. Chapter 6 provides a detailed discussion of vital signs and includes examples.

Temperature is considered only for children younger than three years old. A high fever may prevent young children from being placed in categories 4 and 5. This approach helps to identify children who may have bacteremia and ensures they are not directed to a fast track area or made to wait for an extended period. Detailed pediatric fever guidelines will be provided in Chapter 6.

###### Does Time to Treatment Influence ESI Triage Categories?

Estimating how long a patient can wait before being seen by a doctor is a key part of most triage systems. The Australasian and Canadian Triage Systems specify that patients must be assessed by a physician within a set timeframe according to their triage level. In contrast, the ESI does not set strict time requirements for physician evaluation. Nonetheless, patients classified as ESI level 2 should receive prompt attention, though the exact timing is determined by each institution’s policy. There is often confusion between institutional policies, the actual process of patient care, and the ESI triage level.

We will present four patient cases where there may appear to be a contradiction between patient flow and triage category. Trauma patients often arrive at triage after experiencing a significant injury mechanism, such as being an unrestrained passenger in a high-speed car accident. Sometimes, these patients do not arrive by ambulance but instead come to triage on their own, reporting localized right upper quadrant pain and having stable vital signs. Although this patient is physiologically stable, walked into the emergency department, and does not meet the criteria for ESI level 1, they are still at high risk for injuries like a liver laceration and other serious trauma, so they should be assigned ESI level 2. Many emergency departments have trauma protocols and trauma response levels that require prompt initiation of care. Both triage level and trauma response level are important and should be documented as separate scores. While the triage nurse correctly identifies this as a physiologically stable trauma patient and assigns ESI level 2, she should also ensure the patient is placed and managed according to trauma policy. The patient is likely stable for at least another 10 minutes and does not need immediate life-saving measures. However, if the same patient arrived with a palpable blood pressure of 80, they would be classified as ESI level 1 and would need urgent, life-saving hemodynamic interventions.

Another instance of policies influencing triage levels involves patients presenting with stable chest pain. If a patient is physiologically stable but has chest pain that could indicate an acute coronary syndrome, they qualify for ESI level-2. These patients do not need immediate life-saving measures but are considered high-risk and require prompt attention. An ECG should be completed within 10 minutes of arrival, and many emergency departments have protocols to ensure rapid ECG initiation. Although care for these patients should begin quickly, the ECG itself is a diagnostic tool, not a life-saving intervention. If all patients with chest pain were assigned ESI level-1, it would make it challenging to prioritize those who truly need immediate life-saving care. However, a chest pain patient who arrives at triage sweating and with a palpable blood pressure of 80 would meet ESI level-1 criteria.

A third instance of time-critical care involves patients showing symptoms of an acute stroke. If the patient is physiologically stable, a delay of 10 minutes before starting treatment is unlikely to worsen their condition. On the other hand, a stroke patient who cannot maintain their airway qualifies for ESI level 1.

In another scenario, an elderly patient who has fallen and may have a hip fracture arrives with family by private car and is experiencing significant pain. Although the patient does not strictly qualify for ESI level 2, they are clearly uncomfortable. The triage nurse would assign an ESI level 3 and likely prioritize placing the patient in a bed ahead of other ESI level 3 patients. Similar situations can occur with patients arriving by ambulance. However, arriving by ambulance alone does not justify assigning ESI level 1 or 2. Triage level should always be determined using ESI criteria, regardless of how the patient arrived.

Overall, care for ESI level-2 patients should be expedited, with the goal of ensuring they wait no more than 10 minutes before being moved to the treatment area. It is crucial to note that although ESI version 4 has broadened level-1 criteria to include patients needing immediate interventions who were previously classified as level 2, all level-2 patients remain potentially very ill and need prompt assessment and care. The triage nurse has determined that it is unsafe for these patients to wait. While they may appear stable at present, their condition could quickly worsen, and timely diagnostic or therapeutic interventions may be critical (for example, a stable patient with chest pain should receive an ECG within 10 minutes of arrival), or they may face a possible major threat to life or organ function. ESI level-2 patients are still regarded as being at very high risk.

Given the current issue of ED overcrowding, it is common for triage nurses to encounter multiple ESI level-2 patients when there are no available ED beds. In these circumstances, there may be a temptation to “undertriage,” which can result in significant harm to patients and inaccurately reflect the ED’s patient population. When several ESI level-2 patients arrive at the same time, the triage nurse should assess each one using the ESI algorithm. This allows the nurse to prioritize among the level-2 patients, identifying those at greatest risk to guide decisions about patient placement.

##### Summary

In conclusion, the ESI is a straightforward five-level triage system that categorizes patients according to the severity of their condition and the resources they require. The ESI triage process relies on four main decision points. With this system, an experienced emergency department nurse can quickly and accurately assess and triage patients.

### Chapter 4. ESI Level 2

This chapter builds upon the initial overview of the ESI, emphasizing the importance of the experienced ED nurse’s clinical judgment. The ESI triage training program should allocate significant time to clarifying which patients qualify for ESI level 2. Here, we focus on typical patient scenarios that fulfill the criteria for ESI level 2.

Once the triage nurse has established that the patient does not need urgent life-saving care, the next step is to assess whether the patient can wait. In making this judgment, the triage nurse should ask, “Would I allocate my last available bed to this patient?” The three questions outlined in Figure 4-1 must be addressed, as they are essential elements of the ESI level-2 criteria.

Is this considered a high-risk scenario?

Is the patient showing signs of newly developed confusion, drowsiness, or disorientation?

3. Is the patient in significant pain or discomfort?

The rest of this chapter explores the decision-making aspects of ESI level 2 in depth. Numerous examples are included, illustrating potential medical diagnoses linked to patients’ chief complaints and symptoms. An experienced triage nurse will always evaluate the chief complaint, observed signs and symptoms, patient demographics, and medical history to help identify high-risk situations. Although the goal of nurse triage is not to establish a medical diagnosis, these scenarios rely on the triage nurse’s expertise regarding possible diagnoses related to specific complaints. Resources such as the Emergency Nursing Core Curriculum© and other emergency nursing textbooks offer valuable information on the signs and symptoms of various medical conditions. The following section highlights selected examples of high-risk situations, though it is not meant to be comprehensive. These examples are summarized in Table 4-1.

##### High-risk Situations

Recognizing high-risk situations is essential in the triage decision-making process, no matter which triage system is applied. The ESI emphasizes the significance of identifying high-risk cases and relies on the triage nurse’s knowledge and experience to determine which patients are at elevated risk.

There is limited literature on how emergency department triage nurses make decisions. While knowledge and experience are essential, they are not enough on their own. Another crucial element is intuition or a “sixth sense.” New triage nurses should be taught practical guidelines to follow until they gain the confidence and experience needed to make quick, accurate judgments. Examples of such guidelines include “assume all women of childbearing age are pregnant until proven otherwise” or “consider all chest pain as cardiac in origin until proven otherwise.” Novice nurses are also instructed in recognizing symptom clusters, such as the cardiac cluster of chest pain, nausea, shortness of breath, and sweating. Through previous clinical experiences, ED nurses develop what are known as clinical portraits—memories of specific patient cases they have encountered. For instance, a nurse will always recall a patient with fever, stiff neck, and a meningococcal rash when seeing a similar case in triage. With each triage situation, nurses must rely on their accumulated knowledge and experience. Experienced triage nurses should be able to easily recognize high-risk cases.

Vital signs alone are often insufficient for identifying patients at high risk. Patients usually arrive at the emergency department with a main complaint, symptoms, or a history that points to a potentially serious issue that can quickly worsen if not addressed immediately. Factors such as the patient’s age, medical history, and current medications often affect how severe the main complaint appears. For instance, an elderly, frail individual with intense abdominal pain faces a much greater risk of complications or death compared to a healthy 20-year-old. The older patient with abdominal pain should be assigned an ESI level 2, while the younger adult with stable vital signs is generally categorized as ESI level 3. Triage nurses frequently recognize high-risk cases, which may then be supported by abnormal vital signs. For example, a patient reporting fever and a productive cough might have a respiratory rate of 32 and an oxygen saturation of 90 percent. An experienced triage nurse can use their knowledge to determine that this patient likely has pneumonia, is at risk for further oxygen desaturation, and should be considered high risk. In contrast, less experienced emergency department nurses may lack the necessary skills to reliably identify high-risk situations and make correct triage decisions. As a result, an inexperienced triage nurse can be a liability, regardless of the triage system in place. They have not yet developed the ability to use symptom patterns, clinical scenarios, or intuition—essential tools for recognizing high-risk patients. The following section will outline specific examples of high-risk situations.

###### Abdominal and Gastrointestinal

Abdominal pain is a common reason for visits to the emergency department. What factors make it high risk? Taking a thorough history and evaluating the current pain level, respiratory rate, and heart rate are key components that help identify high-risk cases. Pain severity is just one aspect to consider. If severe abdominal pain is accompanied by tachycardia or respiratory distress, this may indicate shock and puts the patient at higher risk. Elderly patients with severe abdominal pain are also at increased risk, as they are more likely to suffer from bowel obstructions, gastrointestinal bleeding, and other abdominal issues that carry greater morbidity and mortality compared to younger individuals. It is crucial to look for signs and symptoms of an acute abdomen in all patients presenting with abdominal pain. Important questions include: How long has the pain been present? What prompted the patient to seek emergency care today? Has the patient experienced significant nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea? Is there evidence of dehydration? Patients who report severe, “tearing” abdominal pain that radiates to the back should be evaluated for a possible abdominal aortic aneurysm. This pain is typically described as intense, constant, and of sudden onset, and these patients may have a history of hypertension.

Patients presenting with abdominal pain are frequently assigned an ESI level 3 at the start of the triage assessment, but if tachycardia or additional risk factors are identified, the triage nurse may conclude that the patient is actually at high risk.

Vomiting blood or presenting with blood per rectum must be taken seriously and assessed alongside the patient’s vital signs. A 30-year-old with bright red rectal bleeding, stable vital signs, and no additional risk factors does not qualify for ESI level 2. However, an older adult who called emergency services due to vomiting blood and has a heart rate of 117 and a respiratory rate of 24 is considered high risk and does meet the criteria for ESI level 2.

###### Cardiovascular

Chest pain is a frequent reason for seeking medical care. The symptoms of acute coronary syndromes (ACS) can be vague, making it challenging to assess ACS risk during triage. Patients experiencing chest or epigastric discomfort, whether or not they have additional symptoms, typically require a prompt ECG to check for ACS and should be considered high risk—classified as ESI level 2. Triage nurses must be aware of how heart disease can present differently, especially in women. For instance, a 54-year-old obese woman arriving at the emergency department with epigastric pain and fatigue is at risk for ACS and should be assigned to ESI level 2 as high risk. Patients with chest pain who are unstable and need immediate interventions like intubation or hemodynamic support should be categorized as ESI level 1. Not all patients with chest pain fall into level 1 or 2. For example, a healthy 20-year-old with chest pain, cough, and a fever of 101°F is at low risk for ACS and does not meet ESI level 1 or 2 criteria. Each case must be evaluated individually. Other high-risk cardiovascular conditions include possible hypertensive emergencies, acute arterial occlusions, and patients with fever following valve replacement surgery.

###### Dental, Ear, Nose, and Throat

While less frequent, epiglottitis still occurs and poses a possible threat to the airway. Patients with a peritonsillar abscess also face potential airway compromise, and both conditions are considered high-risk. If a patient with either issue is at immediate risk of airway obstruction and needs urgent intervention, they meet level-1 criteria. For those presenting with epistaxis, the triage nurse should check blood pressure, even though this step is not included in the ESI algorithm. Causes of epistaxis may include a posterior nosebleed from a hypertensive crisis, nose picking in a patient taking Coumadin®, or recent cocaine use. Regardless of the cause, these patients should be assigned ESI level 2, as they are considered high-risk.

###### Environmental

Individuals with inhalation injuries are at elevated risk for possible airway obstruction. If a patient exhibits marked airway distress necessitating urgent intervention, they fulfill level-1 criteria.

###### Facial

Individuals who have sustained facial trauma need to be assessed for potential facial fractures. Such fractures frequently occur alongside other serious injuries and can result in airway obstruction, making them high-risk cases that require urgent attention. If facial trauma has already caused airway compromise, the patient should be assigned an ESI level 1 to prioritize airway intervention. Cases with a significant risk of airway compromise should be classified as ESI level 2.

###### General Medical

A number of other general medical issues should be evaluated for potential high-risk scenarios. These complications include diabetic ketoacidosis, abnormal blood sugar levels (either high or low), sepsis, episodes of fainting or near-fainting, and various electrolyte imbalances that may require urgent intervention. Hyperkalemia, in particular, poses a significant risk as it can cause dangerous heart rhythm disturbances. This condition should be considered in dialysis patients who present with weakness. Additionally, cancer patients receiving chemotherapy who develop a fever are at increased risk for sepsis and must be recognized as high-risk and assessed promptly.

###### Genitourinary

Men experiencing testicular torsion typically report intense pain, are readily identifiable, and need prompt assessment, surgical treatment, and immediate pain management. Another high-risk genitourinary emergency involves renal dialysis patients who cannot finish their dialysis sessions, as they may have multiple electrolyte imbalances. Both women and men, though more frequently men, may arrive at triage with sudden urinary retention. Men over 65 often present with benign prostatic hypertrophy leading to an inability to urinate. Postoperative urinary retention can also occur in both sexes. These individuals are in significant distress and require urgent urinary catheterization. Such cases represent patients in severe distress who should be assigned an ESI level 2.

###### Mental Health

Patients presenting with mental health issues are considered high risk if they pose a threat to themselves, others, or their surroundings. Individuals who are suicidal, homicidal, psychotic, violent, or at risk of fleeing should be classified as high risk. Intoxication alone, without evidence of trauma or risk of aspiration, does not qualify as high risk. However, intoxicated patients should be thoroughly evaluated for trauma or behavioral concerns linked to alcohol use or their medical history, as either could indicate a high-risk scenario, warranting an ESI level 2 classification.

###### Neurological

Patients experiencing severe headaches along with changes in mental status, elevated blood pressure, lethargy, fever, or a rash should be regarded as high risk. Additionally, any individual who suddenly develops speech difficulties or motor weakness should be categorized as ESI level 2. These symptoms may indicate an acute stroke, making prompt assessment essential. The time since symptom onset is a key consideration when determining possible treatments, especially for fibrinolytic or other interventions. If a patient with no prior history of headaches arrives at the emergency department with a sudden headache, they should be considered at high risk for a subarachnoid hemorrhage. Such patients often recall exactly what they were doing when the headache started, which frequently follows activities like lifting, having a bowel movement, or engaging in sexual activity.

###### Obstetrical and Gynecological

Women presenting with abdominal pain or vaginal bleeding should be thoroughly evaluated, and vital signs should be recorded unless there is an immediate life-threatening condition. For all women of reproductive age, it is essential to obtain a pregnancy history and determine the date of the last menstrual period. The triage nurse should look for symptoms of abruptio placentae and placenta previa in women who are in late pregnancy. In early pregnancy, assessment should focus on identifying signs of ectopic pregnancy and spontaneous abortion. Pregnant patients who are between 14 and 20 weeks gestation or further along should be promptly evaluated by a physician, following the specific guidelines of the institution. Postpartum women who report heavy vaginal bleeding should also receive urgent medical attention from a physician. Any woman, whether pregnant or postpartum, who exhibits significant hemodynamic instability and requires immediate life-saving measures should be assigned an ESI level 1 during triage.

###### Ocular

Patients who experience eye trauma, sudden partial or complete vision loss, or chemical exposure to the eye are at significant risk for lasting eye damage and should be assigned to ESI level 2 triage. Visual loss can be caused by conditions such as central retinal artery occlusion, acute narrow-angle glaucoma, and retinal detachment. Eye injuries may lead to globe rupture or hyphema. Chemical exposures, especially from alkali substances, require prompt irrigation to minimize corneal injury. Each of these situations demands urgent assessment and intervention to avoid further harm or worsening of the condition. These cases fulfill the requirements for ESI level 2. Although immediate eye irrigation is crucial, it is not classified as a life-saving measure, so these patients do not qualify for ESI level 1.

###### Orthopedic

Patients exhibiting signs and symptoms of compartment syndrome face a significant risk of losing the affected limb and should be categorized as ESI level 2. Other orthopedic injuries considered high-risk include any limb injury with impaired neurovascular status, partial or complete amputations, or injuries resulting from mechanisms known to be high-risk, such as severe acceleration or deceleration. Individuals with suspected fractures of the pelvis, femur, or hip, as well as other limb dislocations, require thorough assessment and monitoring of vital signs, as these injuries can lead to substantial blood loss. If a patient is hemodynamically unstable and requires immediate life-saving intervention, they should be classified as ESI level 1.

###### Pediatrics

Triage nurses often feel uneasy when determining the acuity level for pediatric patients, particularly infants. Gathering a precise history from the caregiver and assessing the child’s activity are crucial steps. A child who cannot be comforted or who appears withdrawn may be at significant risk for severe illness. The situations below illustrate examples of high-risk conditions in children:

Convulsions.

Severe dehydration and sepsis.

A complication of diabetes known as diabetic ketoacidosis.

Burns resulting from child abuse.

Injury to the head.

Overdoses or ingestion of vitamins, iron, or other substances.

An infant younger than 28 days old who has a temperature of 100.4° F (38° C) or higher.

###### Transplant

Patients who have undergone organ transplantation are typically unwell and classified as high risk. They may develop organ rejection, sepsis, or other complications. Individuals awaiting transplantation are also generally regarded as high risk.

###### Respiratory

Numerous respiratory issues can put patients at significant risk. Those experiencing mild to moderate distress should undergo further assessment of their respiratory rate and pulse oximetry to decide if they should be classified as ESI level 2. Patients exhibiting severe respiratory distress who need immediate lifesaving measures, such as intubation, qualify for level-1 categorization. A high-risk patient is someone who is currently breathing and oxygenating sufficiently but is in respiratory distress and at risk of rapid decline. Causes of respiratory distress may include asthma, pulmonary embolism, pleural effusion, pneumothorax, inhalation of toxic smoke, foreign body aspiration, or shortness of breath accompanied by chest pain.

###### Toxicological

The majority of patients presenting with an overdose require prompt assessment, as these cases are considered high risk. Identifying the specific substances ingested and the amounts involved is frequently challenging. If a patient has intentionally overdosed and expresses suicidal thoughts, this also qualifies as a high-risk scenario. Patients who arrive without breathing or need urgent lifesaving measures should be assigned ESI level 1, while all other admitted overdose cases should be classified as ESI level 2.

###### Trauma

Patients who have experienced a traumatic event are often at significant risk for injury, even if no visible injuries are present. Any injury mechanism that carries a high risk should be classified as ESI level 2, unless the patient has unstable vital signs and needs immediate intervention, in which case they should be assigned ESI level 1. Serious injuries occur due to the transfer of mechanical or kinetic energy, typically from acceleration, deceleration, or both. Examples include motor vehicle and motorcycle accidents, falls, and gunshot or stab wounds, all of which involve blunt or penetrating trauma and require thorough assessment for possible severe injury. The triage nurse should gather information such as the patient’s age, any pre-existing medical conditions, environmental factors, the height of a fall or jump, the speed of the vehicle involved, any history of loss of consciousness, the site of a penetrating injury, and the type of weapon used. The nurse will use their understanding of biomechanics and injury mechanisms to evaluate the patient and determine if they meet ESI level 2 criteria. Gunshot wounds to the head, neck, chest, or groin generally necessitate trauma team involvement and immediate care, and should be triaged as ESI level 1.

###### Wound Management

What factors classify a wound as high risk? Is there ongoing, uncontrolled bleeding? Is there evidence of arterial bleeding? Does the injury involve a partial amputation? How did the wound occur, and does the cause put the patient at increased risk for additional traumatic issues? The majority of wounds do not qualify for ESI level 2. For example, a patient with a stab wound to the thigh that only affects the subcutaneous tissue, has bleeding under control, and maintains good neurological function in the limb can be assigned to ESI level 4. However, any wound with uncontrolled bleeding that demands immediate, lifesaving action to stabilize the patient falls under level 1 criteria.

##### Confusion/Lethargy/ Disorientation

The second consideration when assessing if a patient qualifies for level-2 criteria is whether they are experiencing new confusion, lethargy, or disorientation. Changes in mental status are a common reason for seeking care. Patients with these symptoms are often brought to the emergency department by relatives, friends, or emergency personnel. At decision point B in the ESI algorithm, confusion, lethargy, or disorientation indicates a recent or sudden change in consciousness. Ongoing dementia or chronic confusion does not satisfy the requirements for ESI level 2. Acute confusion, lethargy, or disorientation can result from several serious medical issues, such as stroke, transient ischemic attack, other brain structural abnormalities, metabolic or electrolyte disturbances like hypoglycemia or hyponatremia, and toxicological problems.

This part of the algorithm is typically straightforward and offers minimal room for misinterpretation. When a patient arrives at triage with an unknown medical history and is confused, lethargic, or disoriented, the triage nurse should presume these symptoms are new and assign the patient to ESI level 2. However, if the patient exhibits new confusion, lethargy, or disorientation and needs an immediate life-saving intervention as outlined earlier, they should be categorized as ESI level 1.

##### Severe Pain/Distress

The last consideration in deciding if the patient qualifies for level-2 is whether they are experiencing severe pain or distress. The patient must be evaluated for significant pain or distress. Any patient reporting a pain score of 7 out of 10 or higher should be evaluated for ESI level-2 criteria.

The word "considered" holds significant importance. It is ultimately the triage nurse’s judgment to decide if the combination of the patient’s clinical condition and reported pain level justifies assigning an ESI level 2. For instance, a patient whose toe was struck by a heavy metal object might report their pain as 10 out of 10. The patient could indeed have a fracture and be in intense pain, and may not have attempted any pain relief before arriving at the emergency department. In this scenario, the appropriate triage level would be ESI level 4, as only one resource—an x-ray—will be required. The triage nurse should provide comfort measures at triage, such as applying ice, elevating the foot, and administering pain medication if protocols allow, to help alleviate the pain. The nurse should accept the patient’s report of severe pain and address it during triage. Nevertheless, this patient can safely wait to be seen and should not be prioritized for the last available bed. In conclusion, the triage nurse evaluates not just the patient’s reported pain score, but also considers the main complaint, medical history, and the patient’s physical presentation when assigning a triage level. Patients for whom severe pain could justify an ESI level 2 rating include:

A patient experiencing severe (10/10) flank pain and visibly writhing during triage.

An 80-year-old woman experiencing generalized abdominal pain rated 7 out of 10, accompanied by intense nausea.

A 30-year-old individual experiencing an acute pain crisis due to sickle cell disease.

A cancer patient experiencing intense pain.

Any burn, whether full-thickness or partial-thickness, that necessitates prompt pain management.

All emergency department patients should be evaluated for pain and asked to rate their pain using a tool like the visual analog scale. Many triage nurses feel uneasy about recording a patient’s pain score and then having the patient wait to be seen. It is crucial for triage nurses to recognize that a patient’s self-reported pain score is just one aspect of the overall pain assessment. For instance, triage nurses often encounter patients who appear comfortable—such as laughing, talking on the phone, or eating—yet claim their pain is 10 or higher. Triage nurses should assign an ESI level 2 if a patient reports a pain score of 7 out of 10 or more and the nurse’s subjective and objective evaluation indicates that the pain requires interventions beyond what can be provided at triage. In such cases, the triage nurse determines it is inappropriate for the patient to wait and assigns them to the last available bed.

Ultimately, when deciding if a patient qualifies for ESI level-2, the triage nurse needs to evaluate for severe distress, which can be either physiological or psychological. Besides pain, patients with significant respiratory distress fulfill the physiological criteria for ESI level 2. Severe psychological distress may be seen in patients who are:

Overwhelmed with distress following a sexual assault.

Displaying disruptive behavior during triage.

Aggressive.

Individuals who have experienced domestic abuse.

Undergoing an intense response to grief.

These patients are typically prioritized by the triage nurse to be taken directly to the treatment area, allowing them to bypass the waiting room.

##### Summary

We have examined the essential elements and questions required to assess if a patient qualifies for ESI level-2. It is vital for the triage nurse to take these questions into account when evaluating every patient. Overlooking a high-risk scenario could lead to longer wait times and possibly adverse outcomes for the patient.

### Chapter 5. Expected Resource Needs

Historically, triage systems have relied exclusively on assessing the severity of a patient’s condition. In these systems, nurses determine an acuity level by judging how long a patient can safely wait before being evaluated by a healthcare provider. The Emergency Severity Index (ESI) introduces a different method by not only considering which patients require immediate attention, but also, for those with less severe conditions, estimating the resources that will likely be needed to manage their care. This chapter provides background on the rationale for incorporating resource prediction into the ESI and explains what is considered a resource. It also presents examples of patients classified as ESI levels 3 to 5, along with the anticipated resources each will require.

Traditionally, comprehensive triage has served as the primary approach for assigning triage acuity in U.S. emergency departments (Emergency Nurses Association [ENA], 1997, pp. 3-10; Gilboy, Travers & Wuerz, 1999). These triage systems rely on the nurse’s evaluation of vital signs, both subjective and objective data, medical history, allergies, and current medications to determine the level of triage acuity.

Predicting resource needs is a key component of the ESI for patients classified as ESI level 3, 4, or 5. It is essential to note that resource allocation does not apply to patients with high acuity, such as those at ESI level 1 or 2. Resource prediction sets the ESI apart from other triage systems that focus solely on acuity. When Drs. Wuerz and Eitel developed the ESI triage system, they incorporated resource utilization to provide additional information and enable more precise triage decisions. They believed that experienced emergency department (ED) triage nurses could anticipate the types and quantities of tests, treatments, and consultations a patient would require during their ED visit. This has been confirmed by recent studies on ESI implementation and validation, which have demonstrated that triage nurses can accurately predict the resource needs of ED patients (Eitel, Travers, Rosenau, Gilboy & Wuerz, 2003; Tanabe, Gimbel, Yarnold & Adams, 2004). One such study, conducted across seven EDs in diverse regions—including both urban and rural settings, as well as academic and community hospitals—found that nurses using the ESI correctly predicted the number of resources needed by ED patients 70 percent of the time. In other words, ESI categorization by skilled triage nurses reliably forecasts at triage how many resources patients will need to reach ED disposition, and, more importantly, distinguishes between patients who will require low versus high resource intensity. This differentiation based on resource needs enables more efficient patient flow at ED presentation by directing patients into different operational pathways, allowing for parallel processing. Additionally, research has shown that ESI triage levels are associated with significant patient outcomes, such as admission and mortality rates (Eitel et al., 2003).

It is important to remember that resource prediction applies only to patients who are less acutely ill. At decision points A and B in the ESI algorithm (Figure 5-1), the nurse determines if patients qualify for ESI levels 1 or 2 solely based on how severe their condition is. At decision point C, however, the nurse assigns ESI levels 3 through 5 by evaluating both the patient’s acuity and the anticipated resources required. Therefore, the triage nurse takes resource needs into account only if the responses to decision points A and B are “no.”

To determine what resources an ED patient may require, the triage nurse should have a broad understanding of emergency department care standards and, more specifically, know what is considered reasonable and typical emergency care. One simple way to approach this is to consider, “Based on this patient’s main complaint, which resources are emergency providers most likely to use?”

The triage nurse relies on information gathered from a brief subjective and objective assessment, along with the patient’s medical history, current medications, age, and gender, to estimate how many resources the emergency department provider will require to make a decision about the patient’s care. For instance, a healthy teenager with a straightforward leg cut and no significant medical background would likely need just one resource: suturing. Conversely, an elderly patient with several chronic conditions and no prior episodes of dizziness who arrives with a head laceration from a fall will obviously require multiple resources, such as suturing, laboratory tests, an ECG, imaging studies, or specialist consultations. Proper application of the ESI triage system depends on the nurse’s ability to anticipate resource needs, making it most effective when performed by a seasoned emergency nurse. Overall, regardless of the triage method used, we maintain that triage should be conducted by an experienced emergency nurse to ensure patient safety.

Table 5-1 (also shown as Table 3-1) outlines the guidelines for classifying resources in the ESI triage system. The distinction between ESI levels 3, 4, and 5 is based on the nurse’s assessment of the number of resources a patient will require for disposition. According to the triage nurse’s judgment, patients anticipated to need no resources are assigned to level 5, those expected to need one resource are placed in level 4, and patients likely to require two or more resources are categorized as ESI level 3. Research has demonstrated that patients needing two or more resources have increased rates of hospital admission, higher mortality, and longer emergency department stays (Eitel et al., 2003; Tanabe et al., 2004 Reliability and validity).

While Table 5-1 does not include every possible resource, it offers general direction regarding the types of diagnostic tests, procedures, and treatments that are considered resources within the ESI system. Emergency nurses using the ESI should avoid focusing too much on the specific definitions of each resource. The key point is that ESI only requires the triage nurse to estimate the resources a patient will likely need during their ED visit. Table 5-1 lists the most frequently used resources, but compiling an all-inclusive list of ED resources is neither feasible nor required. For accurate ESI assignment, it is sufficient to determine whether a patient will need no resources, one resource, or two or more resources. Once a triage nurse identifies two likely resources, further estimation is unnecessary. The main purpose of the ESI resource component is to distinguish patients with more complex, resource-intensive needs from those with simpler issues. For ESI triage, resources are defined as interventions that go beyond a basic exam or minor interventions by ED staff, or that involve personnel outside the ED. Resources that demand significant ED staff time (such as administering IV medications or inserting a chest tube) or require assistance from outside departments (like radiology for x-rays or surgical consultations) tend to increase the patient’s ED stay and reflect a higher level of complexity and triage category.

There are frequently asked questions regarding what qualifies as an ESI resource. One common question concerns how many blood or urine tests and x-rays count as a resource. According to the ESI triage system, the triage nurse should consider the number of different types of resources required to decide the patient’s disposition, rather than counting each individual test.

A complete blood count (CBC) and an electrolyte panel together make up a single laboratory test resource.

A complete blood count and a chest x-ray are two types of resources (laboratory test and imaging).

A CBC and a urinalysis are both laboratory tests, and when performed together, they are considered a single resource.

A chest x-ray and standard skull radiographs are one type of resource (x-ray).

Cervical spine X-rays and a head CT scan are two imaging resources (X-ray and CT scan).

Another commonly debated resource is the use of a splint, which is not considered a resource. If it were, patients with ankle sprains would be classified as ESI level 3 (requiring an x-ray and splint). Although applying a splint can require significant effort, it’s important to remember that resource prediction is solely intended to categorize patients and ensure they are directed to the appropriate area within the ED. In many emergency departments, ESI level-3 patients are not suitable for fast track or urgent care sections. Triage scores do not reflect the overall intensity of nursing workload.

Another frequently asked question about ESI resources concerns the inclusion of eye irrigation as a resource. Patients who experience a chemical splash to the eye are typically classified as ESI level-2 due to the high-risk nature of their injury, so the need for eye irrigation does not influence their ESI level. On the other hand, if the eye issue is caused by dust particles, the patient is not automatically considered high risk. In such cases, eye irrigation is counted as a resource, placing the patient at ESI level-4. The eye examination itself is not considered a resource since it is part of the standard physical exam. Additional questions about resources are answered in Chapter 5’s Frequently Asked Questions section in Appendix A.

Clinicians often ask about the items categorized as “not resources” in Table 5-1. This list is designed to help triage nurses efficiently and accurately assign patients to one of five clinically distinct levels (Wuerz, Milne, Eitel, Travers & Gilboy, 2000). Items considered not to be resources include physical examinations, point-of-care testing, and procedures that generally do not increase a patient’s length of stay in the emergency department or suggest greater complexity. Because it is standard practice for all ED patients to receive a basic history and physical exam, these assessments—including pelvic exams—are not counted as resources for ESI classification. The strength of the ESI lies in its straightforwardness; the main aim of identifying resources is to distinguish patients with more complex needs who require two or more resources (level 3 or higher) from those with less complicated issues who will likely need fewer than two resources (level 4 or 5). Emergency nurses should avoid overcomplicating the ESI by focusing too much on the specifics of resource definitions. In most cases, a patient will need either no resources, one resource, or two or more resources.

Although resource use can differ depending on the location, provider, or even the individual patient, triage nurses are encouraged to base their ESI resource predictions on the typical management of the most frequent presenting issues. Ideally, patients with similar complaints should require roughly the same resources at any emergency department. For instance, if an 82-year-old nursing home resident with an indwelling urinary catheter arrives with a primary complaint of fever and cough, the provider will likely request blood and urine tests as well as a chest x-ray. The triage nurse can reasonably anticipate that this patient will need two or more resources and should therefore assign an ESI level 3.

While there may be slight differences in procedures among various emergency departments, these usually do not significantly impact the triage rating. For instance, some departments perform pregnancy tests within the ED (which ESI does not count as a resource), while others send the tests to the lab (which ESI does count as a resource). However, it is uncommon for patients to require only a pregnancy test, as most will need at least one additional resource. One operational difference that could lead to varying ESI levels is how patients with a sole complaint of sore throat are managed. In some hospitals, throat cultures are routinely taken (counted as one resource, ESI level 4), whereas in others, they are not (no resources, ESI level 5). Another example is the application of the Ottawa Ankle Rules, which help determine if an ankle x-ray is necessary for patients with ankle injuries. The use of these rules differs between institutions; those that implement them at triage may order fewer x-rays compared to those that do not use the rules regularly.

Temperature is a key factor in evaluating the allocation of resources for infants and young children. This topic will be discussed in Chapter 6.

Clinically, patients classified as ESI level 4 and 5 can wait several hours before being seen by a provider. However, from a customer service perspective, these individuals may be better managed in a fast-track or urgent care environment. Appropriately trained and supervised mid-level practitioners are capable of caring for level-4 and 5 patients. The ESI system also offers an operational benefit, as level-5 patients can occasionally be accommodated for a brief evaluation and disposition by a provider, even when the department is full. Frequently, triage protocols specify that ESI level-4 or 5 patients may be directed to an urgent care or fast-track area.

In conclusion, the ESI introduces a novel method for emergency department triage by incorporating predictions regarding the number of resources required to determine patient disposition. For patients classified as ESI levels 3, 4, and 5, resource needs are factored into the triage level, whereas decisions for ESI levels 1 and 2 rely solely on the severity of the patient's condition. Table 5-2 provides examples of patients in ESI levels 3, 4, and 5. In practice, estimating resource needs has proven highly useful for managing the large volume of patients presenting with non-acute issues.

### Chapter 6.The Role of Vital Signs in ESI Triage

##### Introduction Figure 6-1. Danger Zone Vital Signs

This chapter centers on decision point D, which involves evaluating the patient's vital signs. By this stage in the ESI algorithm, the triage nurse has already established that the patient does not qualify for ESI level 1 or 2 and will need two or more resources. Because the patient requires at least two resources, they are classified as at least ESI level 3. At this juncture, the nurse reviews the patient's vital signs, including heart rate, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation, and, for children under three, temperature as well. If any of the vital signs exceed the danger zone thresholds (as shown in decision point D, Figure 6-1), the nurse should seriously consider upgrading the patient from level 3 to level 2.

In the ESI triage training program, significant time should be allocated to discussing how vital signs impact the decision to reclassify a patient from ESI level 3 to ESI level 2. It must be emphasized that the experienced triage nurse is ultimately responsible for determining if a patient qualifies for ESI level 2, taking into account the patient’s medical history, current medications, and both subjective and objective assessments, including overall appearance. This determination relies on the nurse’s clinical expertise and understanding of normal vital sign ranges across all age groups, as well as the effects of factors like medications, medical history, and pain level.

##### What Are Vital Signs?

Vital signs are typically basic measurements of physiological functions such as temperature, blood pressure, pulse, respiratory rate, and pulse oximetry (refer to Table 6-1). These measurements often guide healthcare professionals in choosing a specific course of action. In recent years, nursing literature has increasingly highlighted the significance of pain, with the American Pain Society introducing the term “Pain: the fifth vital sign” to raise awareness among healthcare providers about the need to assess and manage pain. Pain evaluation is a key part of the ESI and is actually considered earlier in its process. For ESI purposes, the vital sign parameters used at decision point D for children under three years old include heart rate, respiratory rate, oxygen saturation, and temperature. Vital signs provide objective information that helps determine a patient’s general health status and viability. The results influence how we assess a patient’s overall condition and the subsequent steps in diagnosis and treatment. Nevertheless, vital signs alone do not offer a complete understanding of a patient’s state. They can be influenced by various factors such as prescription drugs, herbal supplements, and recreational substances. For instance, beta-blockers can cause a slower heart rate and mask the typical rapid heart rate seen in shock. Hypothyroidism, especially in older adults, may result in low body temperature even during severe infections like sepsis. Similarly, a young adult’s high body temperature could be due to recreational drug use.

Vital signs are fluctuating, dynamic markers that supplement a patient’s assessment. Their measurement can depend on the person taking them, and what is considered normal varies depending on the source referenced. Even in optimal circumstances, vital signs may not always be dependable or precise (Edmonds, Mower, Lovato & Lomeli, 2002). Often, the patient’s overall appearance and clinical context are most informative. Nevertheless, if a triage nurse believes that obtaining vital signs would assist in evaluating risk, they should be recorded. For instance, if a patient is on immunosuppressive drugs, undergoing chemotherapy, or has an illness like AIDS that suppresses the immune system, it is important to check their body temperature.

##### Are Vital Signs Necessary at Triage?

Before the introduction of five-level triage in the United States, it was customary for all patients arriving at an emergency department to have their vital signs measured prior to being assigned a triage level. Vital signs were viewed as a crucial part of the initial nursing evaluation and frequently guided decision-making. In the traditional three-level triage system, vital signs played a key role in determining how long a patient could safely wait for care; if vital signs were normal, the patient was often allowed to wait longer. As a result, vital signs historically carried significant weight in triage assessments, sometimes more so than the patient’s clinical presentation.

Recently, updated triage models recommend that vital signs be used selectively during triage (Gilboy, Travers & Wuerz, 2000). Taking initial vital signs is not a required part of other five-level triage systems and is generally not performed during the triage of level-1 or level-2 patients, who are the most critically ill. For instance, the Guidelines for Implementation of the Australasian Triage Scale in Emergency Departments specify that “vital signs should only be measured at triage if required to estimate urgency, or if time permits” (Australasian College for Emergency Medicine, 2000). Likewise, the Canadian Triage and Acuity Scale (CTAS) states that vital signs are only needed if they are essential for determining the triage level, particularly for levels 3, 4, and 5, and only if time allows (Beveridge et al., 2002). The Manchester Triage Group incorporates specific vital sign criteria as decision points within its flow chart, using these parameters as one of the elements to help the triage nurse determine the patient’s acuity level.

Vital signs are not always the best method for determining triage acuity. Some research indicates that taking vital signs may not be essential during the initial triage assessment. In 2002, Cooper, Flaherty, Lin, and Hubbell studied how vital signs influence triage status, also taking into account factors like age and communication skills. Their research involved over 14,000 patients across 24 U.S. emergency departments. The findings showed that vital signs altered the triage acuity level in only 8% of cases. When looking at specific age groups, children aged 2 or younger experienced the greatest change in triage decisions, with an 11.4% difference after vital signs were measured.

##### Vital Signs and ESI Triage

With ESI triage, the only mandatory situation for checking vital signs is for patients who do not initially qualify as ESI level 1 or 2, but are expected to require two or more resources. For patients assigned to ESI levels 1, 2, 4, or 5, taking vital signs at triage is optional and left to the triage nurse’s judgment. Although the ESI system does not mandate vital sign assessment for every patient at triage, individual institutions may have their own protocols. Hospital policies on vital sign assessment at triage are shaped by factors like staffing, patient mix, and available resources, which are not addressed in this handbook. Generally, it is always acceptable to take vital signs when triaging a stable patient. According to ESI, only level-3 patients are required to have vital signs checked. (Refer to Table 6-2)

The creators of the ESI and the current research team agree that experienced emergency department nurses can use vital sign information to supplement their clinical judgment when assigning ESI ratings to patients. However, there is limited evidence linking abnormal vital signs to emergency department acuity or confirming that these abnormalities reliably indicate serious illness. The ESI has been updated over time to incorporate new evidence and recommendations from the literature. Initially, the ESI working group relied on systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) research (Rangel-Frausto et al., 1995) to develop the danger zone vital sign criteria and related footnotes. The first ESI version used SIRS criteria, including a heart rate over 90 in adults, as a definitive reason to upgrade a patient from ESI level 3 to level 2 (Wuerz, Milne, Eitel, Traers & Gilboy, 2000). The SIRS studies focused on mortality predictors in intensive care unit patients. Due to a high number of false positives when applying these criteria to emergency department patients in the initial ESI hospitals, the heart rate threshold was increased to 100 in ESI version 2, and nurses were advised to consider upgrading adult patients with heart rates above 100 to ESI level 2 (Wuerz et al., 2001; Gilboy, Tanabe, Travers, Eitel & Wuerz, 2003). Pediatric vital sign parameters were also incorporated into the danger zone vital signs criteria.

When applying ESI as a triage method, it is not required to assess vital signs in the triage area for patients who are promptly assigned to level 1 or 2. If a patient appears unstable or has a primary complaint that demands immediate intervention, they should be quickly moved to the treatment area. In such cases, the resuscitation team is tasked with obtaining and monitoring vital signs at the bedside. This includes patients whose clinical presentation suggests a high risk or an urgent need for cardiovascular or respiratory support, such as those who look pale, sweaty, or cyanotic. Nevertheless, the triage nurse may choose to check vital signs in the triage area if there is no available bed or if they believe that vital sign data could help confirm the patient’s triage level. Some patients may only be recognized as ESI level 1 after their vital signs are measured. For instance, an elderly patient who is awake and alert but complains of dizziness may be found to have a critical condition if their heart rate is discovered to be 32 or 180 during the assessment.

As outlined in the ESI algorithm in Chapter 3, when patients do not qualify for ESI level-1 or 2, the triage nurse proceeds to decision point C. At this stage, the nurse evaluates how many resources the patient is likely to require in the emergency department. If only one or no resources are anticipated, the patient can be categorized as ESI level 4 or 5, and a vital sign check is not needed. However, if two or more resources are expected to be necessary, the nurse moves to decision point D, where vital signs should be measured. Vital signs are particularly significant for some patients during triage, especially those assigned to ESI level 3, as their values can provide additional evidence of possible serious illness. If any vital signs fall within the danger zone, it is advised that the triage nurse consider upgrading the patient from level 3 to level 2.

The ESI triage system specifically incorporates heart rate, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation (for patients who may have respiratory issues) as vital signs. Temperature is only factored into ESI triage for children younger than three years old. Notably, blood pressure is not part of the ESI algorithm when evaluating abnormal vital signs. However, this does not imply that triage nurses should avoid measuring blood pressure or temperature in older children or adults; rather, these measurements are not typically used to determine the correct triage acuity level.

##### Vital Signs and Pediatric Fever

In this edition of the ESI Handbook, version 4 (v.4) of the ESI algorithm has been revised to reflect updated pediatric fever guidelines. As illustrated in Figure 6-2, note D of the ESI algorithm covers pediatric fever criteria relevant to ESI triage. This portion includes guidance from the American College of Emergency Physicians’ Clinical Policy for Children Under Three Years Old Presenting to the Emergency Department With Fever (ACEP, 2003).

The ESI Triage Research Team advises that vital signs should be checked in patients younger than 3 years old during triage. Specifically, taking a temperature is crucial for all children from birth up to 36 months, and assessing vital signs is a key part of evaluating any infant under 36 months with a known fever (Baraff, 2000). This process helps distinguish between ESI level-2 and level-3 patients and reduces the chance that children who may have bacteremia are directed to express care or face an inappropriate delay. It is important to note that any patient who is at immediate risk or in serious danger will be categorized as ESI level 1 or 2.

Table 6-3 offers guidance to triage nurses on using the ESI to evaluate febrile children and select the most suitable triage level. Fever is commonly defined as a rectal temperature above 38.0° C (100.4° F) (Baraff et al., 1993; ACEP, 2003). Infants younger than 28 days with a fever should be regarded as high risk and given at least an ESI level 2. For infants aged 28 days to 3 months, there are no definitive guidelines. The ESI research team advises triage nurses to follow their hospital’s local protocols. It is recommended that nurses consider assigning at least an ESI level 2 to these patients.

In version 4 of the ESI, we have adopted a different set of guidelines for managing fever in children aged 3 to 36 months. These guidelines focus on children with high fevers, defined as temperatures above 39.0° C (102.2° F) (ACEP, 2003). When evaluating a highly febrile child in this age group, the triage nurse should determine the child’s immunization status and whether there is a clear cause for the fever. If the child is not fully immunized or if no source for the fever can be identified, the child should be categorized as at least ESI level 3. However, if the child’s immunizations are current and there is an identifiable reason for the fever, an ESI level of 4 or 5 is suitable. For instance, a 7-month-old who is under pediatric care, has received the Haemophilus influenza type b (HIB) vaccine, and presents with a fever while tugging at his ear could be classified as ESI level 5.

##### Case Examples

The case studies below illustrate how vital signs information is utilized during ESI triage.

A healthy-appearing 28-year-old woman states, “My doctor said I’m around 6 weeks pregnant, and now I believe I might be having a miscarriage.” She reports, “I began spotting this morning and am now experiencing cramps.” She has no allergies or past medical history and is taking prenatal vitamins. Her vital signs are: temperature 98°F, heart rate 112, respiratory rate 22, and blood pressure 90/60.

This patient qualifies for an upgrade from level 3 to level 2 triage due to her vital signs. Her elevated heart rate and respiratory rate, along with low blood pressure, are worrisome. These symptoms may suggest internal hemorrhage caused by a ruptured ectopic pregnancy.

The mother of a 15-month-old reports that her baby has been experiencing diarrhea since the previous day. She mentions that everyone in the family has recently had the gastrointestinal virus that is circulating. The baby has shown reduced appetite, a mild fever, and several episodes of watery stools. The child is calmly sitting on the mother’s lap. The triage nurse observes indications of dehydration. There is no past medical history, no known drug allergies, and the baby is not on any medications. Vital signs are: temperature 100.4°F, heart rate 142, respiratory rate 48, and blood pressure 76/50.

This patient qualifies for at least ESI level 3. He will need laboratory tests and intravenous fluids as resources. Given his vital signs, the triage nurse may escalate him to ESI level 2. For an infant of this age, both heart rate and respiratory rate fall outside the normal range.

A 57-year-old woman states, “I need to see a doctor about my cough. I just can’t get rid of it. I barely slept last night because I was coughing so much, and now I’m extremely tired.” She mentions having a fever of 101° last night and is producing yellow sputum when she coughs. Her medical history includes a hysterectomy three years ago; she is not on any medications but is allergic to penicillin. Her vital signs are: temperature 101.4°, respiratory rate 28, heart rate 100, and oxygen saturation 90 percent.

At the start of her triage evaluation, this patient appears to possibly have pneumonia. She is likely to require two or more resources, but her low oxygen levels and rapid breathing are worrisome. Based on her vital signs, the triage nurse should upgrade her to an ESI level 2.

A 34-year-old obese woman arrives at triage with complaints of diffuse abdominal pain rated 6 out of 10, ongoing for the past two days. She reports multiple episodes of vomiting and notes that her last bowel movement was three days ago. Her medical history includes back surgery; she is not on any medications and has a peanut allergy. Her vital signs are: temperature 97.8°F, heart rate 104, respiratory rate 16, blood pressure 132/80, and oxygen saturation 99%.

This patient will require at least two resources, such as laboratory tests, IV fluids, possibly IV medication for nausea, and a CT scan. The triage nurse should assess the patient’s vital signs, paying attention to the heart rate. Although the heart rate is slightly outside the normal range for the patient’s age, this may be attributed to pain or physical activity. Therefore, the appropriate action is to categorize the patient as ESI level 3.

A crying 9-year-old arrives at triage with her mother after slipping on an icy sidewalk and hurting her right forearm. The forearm appears clearly deformed, but circulation, sensation, and movement are intact. According to her mother, the child has no allergies, is not on any medications, and is otherwise healthy. Her vital signs are: blood pressure 100/68, heart rate 124, respiratory rate 32, and oxygen saturation 99 percent.

The child is in pain from her fall and is clearly distressed. She will need at least two resources: an x-ray and an orthopedic consultation, and possibly conscious sedation. Although her heart rate and breathing are increased, the triage nurse can confidently assign her to ESI level 3. The changes in her vital signs are most likely caused by pain and emotional upset.

A 72-year-old woman arrives at the emergency department using nasal cannula oxygen for her severe COPD. She tells the triage nurse about an infected cat bite on her left hand, which appears red, swollen, and tender. She has no other health issues, uses albuterol as needed, and takes a daily aspirin. She has no known drug allergies. Her vital signs are: temperature 99.6°F, heart rate 88, respiratory rate 22, blood pressure 138/80, and oxygen saturation 91%. She reports no difficulty breathing.

This patient needs at least two resources: laboratory tests and intravenous antibiotics. She qualifies for ESI level 3. Although the triage nurse observes that her oxygen saturation and respiratory rate fall outside the normal adult range, the patient has advanced COPD. Therefore, these vital signs are not worrisome, and she will remain at ESI level 3 without being up-triaged.

Although the heart rate is slightly outside the normal range for the patient’s age, this may be attributed to pain or physical activity. Therefore, the appropriate action is to categorize the patient as ESI level 3.

A crying 9-year-old arrives at triage with her mother after slipping on an icy sidewalk and hurting her right forearm. The forearm appears clearly deformed, but circulation, sensation, and movement are intact. According to her mother, the child has no allergies, is not on any medications, and is otherwise healthy. Her vital signs are: blood pressure 100/68, heart rate 124, respiratory rate 32, and oxygen saturation 99 percent.

The child is in pain from her fall and is clearly distressed. She will need at least two resources: an x-ray and an orthopedic consultation, and possibly conscious sedation. Although her heart rate and breathing are increased, the triage nurse can confidently assign her to ESI level 3. The changes in her vital signs are most likely caused by pain and emotional upset.

A 72-year-old woman arrives at the emergency department using nasal cannula oxygen for her advanced COPD. She tells the triage nurse that she has an infected cat bite on her left hand, which appears red, swollen, and tender. She has no other health issues, uses albuterol as needed, and takes daily aspirin. She has no known drug allergies. Her vital signs are: temperature 99.6°F, heart rate 88, respiratory rate 22, blood pressure 138/80, and oxygen saturation 91%. She reports no difficulty breathing.

This patient needs at least two resources: laboratory tests and intravenous antibiotics. She qualifies for ESI level 3. Although the triage nurse observes that her oxygen saturation and respiratory rate fall outside the normal adult range, the patient has advanced COPD. Therefore, these vital signs are not worrisome in her case, and she will remain at ESI level 3 without being up-triaged.

##### Conclusion

This chapter lays the groundwork for comprehending how vital signs are used within the Emergency Severity Index triage system. It also discusses the unique considerations for patients younger than 36 months. More research is needed to determine the most appropriate vital sign thresholds for emergency department triage. Additional studies will focus on pediatric patients arriving at the emergency department. We anticipate that future updates to the ESI will incorporate more evidence about how well triage vital signs predict outcomes for both pediatric and adult patients.

###### Frequently Asked Questions

1. Is it necessary to raise the triage level for an adult patient if their heart rate exceeds 100?

No, it is something to take into account.

2. Is it necessary to increase a patient’s triage level if their pain score is 7 out of 10 or higher?

No, this is just one aspect to take into account.

3. Should a patient who is chronically confused always be assigned to ESI level 2?

No, patients who experience a sudden alteration in their level of consciousness are classified as ESI level 2.

4. At what times should vital signs be measured?

For any patient classified as ESI level-3, vital signs are always taken if the triage nurse believes they could be helpful.

###### Frequently Asked Questions

1. Is it necessary to assign an ESI triage level of 2 to a 25-year-old woman who reports her pain as 10 out of 10 but is eating potato chips?

No. Since her vital signs are stable and she doesn’t meet any high-risk criteria, this patient should be categorized as ESI level 3. She will probably require lab tests and at least two resources, such as x-rays, an IV, or pain medication. Therefore, you should not allocate your last available bed to her.

Should an 80-year-old woman with ongoing confusion be assigned an ESI level 2 during triage?

No. The sudden appearance of confusion, lethargy, or disorientation qualifies for ESI level 2.

3. Shouldn’t a patient experiencing active chest pain be assigned an ESI level 1? After all, they ought to receive the highest priority.

Not every patient presenting with chest pain qualifies for ESI level-1. Patients who are unresponsive, without a pulse, not breathing, or in need of urgent life-saving measures fall under level-1. Those with chest pain who appear pale, sweaty, have low blood pressure, or slow heart rate and need rapid IV access to stabilize their condition are also considered level-1. Patients who are stable but experiencing ongoing chest pain generally meet high-risk criteria and should be assigned ESI level 2, with prompt placement arranged.

###### Frequently Asked Questions

1. Why isn’t teaching someone how to walk with crutches considered a resource?

Although teaching patients how to use crutches can take up a significant amount of the emergency department staff’s time, this instruction is frequently given to individuals with uncomplicated ankle sprains. These cases are generally categorized as ESI level 4 (ankle x-ray = one resource). Such patients are clearly less acute and require fewer resources compared to more complicated cases, such as those with tibia or fibula fractures, who are typically ESI level 3 (leg x-rays, orthopedic consultation, casting or splinting, IV pain management = two or more resources). Using a nursing resource intensity measure would more accurately capture the ED staff’s efforts involved in providing crutch-walking instruction.

2. Why doesn’t a splint qualify as a resource?

Using basic, pre-made splints (like those for ankle sprains) does not count as a resource. However, when ED staff create and apply splints, such as thumb spica splints for thumb fractures, this is considered a resource. To distinguish between patients with extremity injuries: those suspected of having fractures should be assigned ESI 3 (requiring two or more resources, such as x-rays, pain medication, and the creation and application of splints or casts), while patients who likely have simple sprains should be classified as ESI level 4.

3. Why is a saline or heparin lock not considered a resource?

In general, placing a heparin lock does not require much time from the emergency department staff. Nevertheless, most patients who receive heparin locks also need at least two additional resources, such as lab tests or IV medications, which typically results in them being categorized as ESI level 3 regardless.

Are all patients undergoing conscious sedation classified as ESI level 3 or above?

Conscious sedation is regarded as a complex procedure (requiring two resources) and is typically carried out on patients who are also undergoing laboratory tests, x-rays, or additional interventions like fracture reduction or dilation and curettage.

5. Are eye irrigation, administration of nebulized medications, and blood transfusions classified as resources?

All three are regarded as resources when assigning ESI triage ratings. These resources are typically utilized for more acute patients, demand considerable time from ED staff, and are likely to result in longer patient stays.

6. Do all patients with asthma fall under ESI level 4 since they need nebulized medication?

No. Asthma patients who are stable and only need nebulized medication are classified as ESI level 4. Some, however, experience severe respiratory distress and qualify for ESI level 2. Others fall in between, needing intravenous steroids or an x-ray along with nebulized treatments, and are categorized as ESI level 3. Lastly, those who just need a prescription refill for their inhaler are placed in ESI level 5, as they do not need any resources.

###### Frequently Asked Questions

Why is it unnecessary to obtain vital signs when triaging patients classified as ESI level 1 or 2?

Vital signs are not required to classify patients as life-threatening (ESI level 1) or high-risk (ESI level 2). Because patients at ESI levels 1 and 2 are in critical condition, the medical team must act promptly. Multiple interventions can take place at the same time, and vital signs may be obtained during the initial evaluation in the main acute section of the emergency department.

2. Why are vital signs not mandatory for patients classified as ESI level-4 and 5?

Vital signs are not required to classify patients as low or no resource (ESI level 4 or 5). Additionally, the pain, anxiety, and discomfort experienced during an emergency department visit can often affect a patient’s vital signs, which may normalize soon after the initial evaluation. However, if there are indications of abnormal symptoms—such as changes in skin color, mental status, dizziness, or sweating—a nurse may decide to check vital signs. If there are no physical signs suggesting the need for vital sign assessment, the patient can be directed to the main emergency department or an express care room.

3. What is the reason for taking vital signs on patients classified as ESI level-3?

Vital signs help distinguish between patients who require multiple resources and are stable (ESI level 3) and those who may be unstable or at higher risk (ESI level 2). Sometimes, patients classified as ESI level 3 may actually have unstable vital signs despite appearing stable. For ESI level-3 patients, checking vital signs acts as an important safety measure. Typically, ESI level-3 patients have more complex conditions and many end up being admitted to the hospital. Because they are not suitable for the fast-track area, these patients may have to wait longer for definitive care. They pose a particular challenge during triage, making it essential for caregivers to use vital signs to ensure the correct ESI level is assigned.

4. Why are temperatures always taken for pediatric patients under 36 months of age?

Temperature helps distinguish pediatric patients who require few or no resources (ESI level 4 or 5) from those likely to need multiple resources. In infants younger than three months, an abnormal temperature can suggest bacteremia and categorize the child as high-risk.

5. Why does the literature offer differing perspectives on the importance of vital signs in the triage process?

There is no conclusive evidence regarding the usefulness of vital signs in emergency department triage. Numerous elements can impact the reliability of vital sign measurements, which are somewhat dependent on the person performing the assessment. In certain situations, factors like long-term medication use (such as beta-blockers) can influence vital signs. Additionally, vital signs can serve to meet some public health responsibilities that emergency departments have. Finally, they are also useful for categorizing young pediatric patients into different groups.

6. Does JCAHO mandate that vital signs be taken during triage?

The Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations does not explicitly set a standard for vital signs. However, it does state that physiological parameters should be evaluated based on the patient's condition.

7. Should the vital sign thresholds in the danger zone box be strictly enforced?

In everyday practice, surpassing the danger zone vital sign thresholds leads to up-triage being “considered” instead of being done automatically. The skilled triage nurse must rely on sound clinical judgment to assign the patient’s ESI level. This decision involves evaluating the patient’s vital signs, medical history, medications, and overall clinical presentation. Further research is necessary to assess how well vital signs predict outcomes during triage and to establish definitive criteria for up-triage.

8. What should be done if patients classified as ESI level-4 or 5 exhibit danger zone vital signs?

Although taking vital signs is not necessary to assign ESI levels 4 or 5, many patients may still have their vitals checked during triage if that is part of the emergency department’s standard procedures. According to the ESI triage guidelines, the triage nurse does not need to consider vital signs when determining if a patient qualifies for ESI level 5 (no resources needed) or ESI level 4 (one resource needed). Nevertheless, in real-world settings, a careful nurse will use clinical judgment and may factor in vital sign data when assigning the ESI level. For example, if a patient only wants a prescription refill, has no acute symptoms, and presents with a heart rate of 104 after walking to the ED, the nurse may still assign an ESI level 5. Conversely, if the same patient has a heart rate of 148 and it is irregular, the nurse should assign an ESI level 2. The triage nurse must also address situations such as elevated blood pressure in a patient otherwise classified as ESI level 4 or 5. If the patient has no symptoms related to the high blood pressure, the triage level should remain unchanged. Typically, elevated blood pressure in an asymptomatic patient will not be managed in the ED, but it is important to refer the patient to a primary care provider for further evaluation and long-term management.
