**Patient Name:** John Doe  
**Date of Birth:** 01/15/1980  
**Date of Visit:** 10/10/2023  
**MRN:** 123456  
**Gender:** Male  
**Ethnicity:** White  

**Chief Complaint:**  
The patient presents with abdominal pain.

**History of Present Illness:**  
John Doe is a 43-year-old male who reports a 2-day history of intermittent abdominal pain, which he describes as a dull ache located in the periumbilical region. The pain has progressively worsened, becoming more constant and severe over the last 12 hours. He rates the pain as a 13 on a scale of 1 to 10, with 10 being the worst pain imaginable. The patient denies any associated nausea or vomiting but reports a decreased appetite and some mild bloating. He has not had any changes in bowel habits, and there is no history of recent travel or dietary changes.

**Past Medical History:**  
- Hypertension, well-controlled on medication  
- No previous abdominal surgeries  
- No known drug allergies  

**Medications:**  
- Lisinopril 10 mg daily  
- Atorvastatin 20 mg daily  

**Social History:**  
John is a non-smoker and consumes alcohol socially, approximately 1-2 drinks per week. He works as an accountant and leads a sedentary lifestyle. He lives alone and has no significant family history of gastrointestinal diseases.

**Review of Systems:**  
- **Constitutional:** No fever, chills, or weight loss.  
- **Gastrointestinal:** Positive for abdominal pain; negative for nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or constipation.  
- **Cardiovascular:** No chest pain or palpitations.  
- **Respiratory:** No shortness of breath or cough.  

**Vital Signs:**  
- Temperature: 98.8°F  
- Heart Rate: 72 bpm

- **Cardiovascular:** Regular rate and rhythm, no murmurs.  
- **Respiratory:** Clear to auscultation bilaterally.  

**Assessment:**  
The patient presents with significant abdominal pain, likely secondary to a gastrointestinal issue, possibly an obstruction or inflammatory process given the vital signs and clinical presentation. The low blood pressure (98/48 mmHg) may indicate dehydration or a response to pain.

**Plan:**  
1. **Laboratory Tests:**  
   - Complete blood count (CBC)  
   - Comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP)  
   - Lipase  
   - Urinalysis  

2. **Imaging:**  
   - Abdominal ultrasound to assess for any abnormalities such as gallstones or signs of appendicitis.  

3. **IV Fluids:**  
   - Start IV fluids to address potential dehydration and maintain blood pressure.

**Chief Complaint:**
The patient presents with Diabetic Ketoacidosis (DKA) and is being transferred from an outside facility for further management.

**History of Present Illness:**
John Doe is a 32-year-old male with a known history of Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus, diagnosed at age 15. He has been non-compliant with his insulin regimen over the past few weeks, leading to poor glycemic control. The patient reports increased thirst, frequent urination, and fatigue over the last several days. He also notes a recent episode of nausea and vomiting, which has worsened over the past 24 hours. 

The patient was initially evaluated at an outside clinic where he was found to have elevated blood glucose levels and ketones in his urine. Due to the severity of his condition, he was stabilized and subsequently transferred to our facility for more intensive management of DKA.

**Vital Signs on Admission:**
- Temperature: 97.8°F
- Heart Rate: 115 bpm (tachycardic)

The patient was transferred from an outside facility with a diagnosis of Diabetic Ketoacidosis (DKA).

**History of Present Illness:**
Jane is a 28-year-old female with a known history of Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus, diagnosed at age 12. She presented to the outside facility with symptoms of polyuria, polydipsia, and significant fatigue over the past three days. The patient reported that she had been unable to keep food down due to nausea and vomiting, which worsened over the last 24 hours. She also noted a fruity odor to her breath, which prompted her family to seek medical attention.

Upon evaluation at the outside facility, her blood glucose level was found to be significantly elevated at 450 mg/dL, and her arterial blood gas analysis revealed metabolic acidosis with a pH of 7.25. The patient was started on intravenous fluids and insulin therapy but required transfer to a higher level of care due to persistent tachycardia and respiratory distress.

**Vital Signs on Admission:**
- **Temperature:** 97.8°F
- **Heart Rate:** 115 bpm
- **Respiratory Rate:** 20 breaths/min
- **Oxygen Saturation:** 99% on room air

**Patient Name:** Maria Gonzalez  
**Date of Birth:** 04/15/1985  
**Date of Visit:** 10/10/2023  
**Time:** 14:30  
**MRN:** 123456789  
**Gender:** Female  
**Ethnicity:** Hispanic  

**Chief Complaint:**  
Patient presents with Diabetic Ketoacidosis (DKA) and is being transferred from an outside facility for further management.

**History of Present Illness:**  
Maria Gonzalez is a 38-year-old Hispanic female with a known history of Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus, who was brought to the emergency department by ambulance after experiencing worsening symptoms over the past 24 hours. The patient reports increased thirst, frequent urination, nausea, and abdominal pain. She has been unable to keep food down and has noticed a fruity odor to her breath. 

The patient was initially seen at an outside clinic where her blood glucose was found to be significantly elevated. She was started on IV fluids and insulin but continued to exhibit signs of metabolic derangement. Due to the severity of her condition, she was transferred to our facility for more intensive management of her DKA.

**Vital Signs on Arrival:**  
- Temperature: 97.8°F  
- Heart Rate: 115 bpm  
- Respiratory Rate: 20 breaths/min  
- Oxygen Saturation: 99% on room air  
- Blood Pressure: 92/42 mmHg  

**Physical Examination:**  
- General: Patient appears fatigued and mildly dehydrated.  
- HEENT: Oral mucosa dry, no oral lesions.  
- Cardiovascular: Tachycardic, regular rhythm, no murmurs.  
- Respiratory: Clear to auscultation bilaterally, mild tachypnea noted.  
- Abdomen: Soft, non-tender, no distension.  
- Extremities: Warm, capillary refill <2 seconds, pulses intact.  
- Neurological: Alert and oriented to person, place, and time.

**Laboratory Results:**  
- Blood Glucose: 450 mg/dL  
- Serum Ketones: Positive  
- Arterial Blood Gas: pH 7.25, HCO3 15 mEq/L, pCO2 30 mmHg  
- Electrolytes: Sodium 135 mEq/L, Potassium 5.5 mEq/L, Chloride 100 mEq/L, BUN 35 mg/dL, Creatinine 1.2 mg/dL  

**Assessment:**  
The patient is presenting with Diabetic Ketoacidosis secondary to poor glycemic control, likely exacerbated by recent illness and inadequate insulin administration. The hypotension and tachycardia suggest significant volume depletion and possible septic component, warranting close monitoring and aggressive fluid resuscitation.

**Plan:**  
1. Initiate IV fluids with normal saline at 1 liter/hour for the first 2 hours, then reassess.  
2. Start continuous insulin infusion at 0.1 units/kg/hour, adjusting based on blood glucose levels.  
3. Monitor vital signs every 15 minutes for the first hour, then every 30 minutes.  
4. Obtain repeat labs in 2 hours to assess glucose, electrolytes, and ketone levels.  
5. Consult endocrinology for management of DKA and diabetes education.  
6. Consider admission to the ICU for closer monitoring given the patient's hemodynamic instability.  
7. Educate the patient on the importance of regular blood glucose monitoring and adherence to insulin therapy to prevent future episodes.

**Disposition:**  
Patient will be admitted to the ICU for further management of DKA and close monitoring of vital signs and laboratory values.
