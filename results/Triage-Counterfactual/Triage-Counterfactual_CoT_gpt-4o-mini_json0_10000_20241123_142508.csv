   - Systolic blood pressure is elevated (173 mmHg), which could indicate hypertension.

   - DVT is a serious condition that can lead to complications such as pulmonary embolism. However, the patient does not appear to be in acute distress based on the vital signs provided. 
   - The patient reports no pain (pain score of 0), which is a positive sign.

2. **Chief Complaint**: The chief complaint of 'Transfer, Abnormal EKG' suggests that the patient may have a cardiac issue that requires further evaluation.

   - Temperature is within normal range. 
   - Heart rate is normal (60-100 bpm). 
   - Respiratory rate is normal (12-20 breaths per minute). 
   - Oxygen saturation is normal (above 95%). 
   - Blood pressure is slightly low (normal range is typically 90/60 to 120/80), but not critically low. 

2. **Chief Complaint**: 
   - BRBPR can indicate a potential gastrointestinal bleed, which can be serious but is not immediately life-threatening unless accompanied by other severe symptoms. 
   - The absence of pain and stable vital signs suggest that the patient is not in immediate distress. 

3. **Acuity Level Determination**: 
   - Based on the ESI criteria, this patient does not require immediate life-saving interventions (Level 1). 
   - The patient is stable but has a concerning symptom (BRBPR) that requires evaluation but is not critical (Level 2). 
   - Given the stable vital signs and lack of acute distress, this case does not fit Level 3 (which typically involves more complex cases requiring multiple resources).

,2,"To determine the acuity level using the Emergency Severity Index (ESI) Five Level triage system, we need to assess the patient's vital signs and chief complaint. The patient presents with abdominal pain and back pain, which can indicate a variety of conditions, some of which may be serious. The vital signs show a temperature of 98.6°F, heart rate of 108 bpm (tachycardia), respiratory rate of 18 breaths per minute (normal), oxygen saturation of 95% (slightly low but acceptable), systolic blood pressure of 143 mmHg (elevated), and diastolic blood pressure of 61 mmHg (low). The pain level is reported as 7 out of 10, indicating significant discomfort. Given the elevated heart rate, abdominal pain, and the level of pain reported, this patient likely requires urgent evaluation and treatment. Therefore, the acuity level is assessed as Level 2, which indicates a high priority but not immediately life-threatening. Level 1 would be reserved for patients who are critically ill or require immediate life-saving interventions.",10007795,34807453,98.6,108.0,18.0,95.0,143.0,61.0,7,3.0,"Abd pain, Back pain",American Indian,Women
