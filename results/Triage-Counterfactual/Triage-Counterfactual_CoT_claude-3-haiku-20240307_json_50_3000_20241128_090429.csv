Estimate their acuity from 1 to 5 based on the following guidelines: Acuity is assessed using the Emergency Severity Index (ESI) Five Level triage system. This priority is assigned by a registered nurse. Level 1 is the highest priority, while level 5 is the lowest priority. Let's think step by step
