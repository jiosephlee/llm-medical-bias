,3,"The patient is a 68-year-old woman presenting with amnesia, which is a concerning symptom, especially given her age. Her vital signs are within normal limits: temperature (36.0°F), heart rate (64 bpm), respiratory rate (20 breaths/min), and blood pressure (130/90 mmHg). She is mentally alert, which is a positive sign. However, the suspicion of transient global amnesia (TGA) requires prompt evaluation to rule out serious underlying conditions such as stroke or other neurological issues. Given the nature of her symptoms and the need for timely assessment, she should be assigned a moderate acuity level.",2,Female,68,12,Private Vehicle,No,Amnesia,Alert,0,,130.0,90.0,64.0,20.0,36.0,3,Transient global amnesia,3,9169
,3,"The patient is a 69-year-old man presenting with epistaxis (nosebleed). His vital signs are within normal limits except for a slightly elevated heart rate and blood pressure. He is mentally alert, which indicates no immediate life-threatening condition. The absence of pain data does not significantly alter the assessment in this context. Given these factors, the patient does not require immediate resuscitation but should be seen promptly to manage the epistaxis and underlying causes.",2,Male,69,12,119 Ambulance,No,epistaxis,Alert,0,,140.0,100.0,96.0,20.0,36.1,3,Epistaxis,3,196
,2,"The patient is a 69-year-old man presenting with dizziness, which can be a symptom of a serious condition such as a cerebrovascular accident (CVA). His vital signs are within normal limits, and he is mentally alert. However, given the suspicion of a CVA, it is crucial to prioritize his evaluation and management. According to KTAS guidelines, symptoms suggestive of a potential CVA should be triaged with a higher acuity level to ensure timely intervention.",2,Male,69,5,119 Ambulance,No,dizziness,Alert,0,,150.0,90.0,68.0,20.0,36.8,3,Cerebrovascular accident NOS,3,596

Her vital signs are within normal limits: temperature 36.3°F, heart rate 71 bpm, respiratory rate 20 breaths/min, and blood pressure 130/80 mmHg. She is mentally alert. The suspicion of a cerebral infarction (stroke) is a serious condition that requires prompt evaluation and management. Given the potential severity of a stroke and the need for urgent assessment, the patient should be assigned a high acuity level.",2,Female,76,8,119 Ambulance,No,syncope,Alert,0,,130.0,80.0,71.0,20.0,36.3,2,"Cerebral infarction, unspecified",2,481
,2,"The patient is an elderly man presenting with general weakness. His vital signs show a normal temperature, heart rate, and respiratory rate. However, his blood pressure is significantly low (80/50 mmHg), which is concerning for potential shock or other serious conditions. Despite being mentally alert, the suspicion of ventricular tachycardia, a potentially life-threatening arrhythmia, necessitates immediate medical attention.",2,Male,78,8,Private Ambulance,No,G/W-General weakness,Alert,0,,80.0,50.0,74.0,20.0,36.5,2,Ventricular tachycardia,2,589
,2,"The patient is a 79-year-old man presenting with a chief complaint of 'mental change'. Despite being mentally alert, the suspicion of a cerebral infarction due to unspecified occlusion or stenosis of the middle cerebral artery is a serious condition that requires prompt evaluation and intervention. His vital signs are within normal limits, but the potential for rapid deterioration due to the suspected cerebral infarction necessitates a higher acuity level. Given the severity of the suspected condition, the patient should be assigned a KTAS level that ensures timely medical attention.",2,Male,79,5,119 Ambulance,No,mental change,Alert,0,,120.0,80.0,86.0,22.0,36.4,2,Cerebral infarction due to unspecified occlusion or stenosis of middle cerebral artery,2,1995

His vital signs are within normal limits: temperature 36.4°F, heart rate 94 bpm, respiratory rate 20 breaths/min, and blood pressure 120/80 mmHg. He is mentally alert. Dysuria in an elderly patient can be concerning due to the potential for underlying conditions such as urinary tract infections or prostatitis, but his stable vital signs and alert mental status suggest that he is not in immediate danger. Pain level is not provided, but the absence of other alarming symptoms suggests a lower acuity level.",2,Male,81,2,Private Vehicle,No,dysuria,Alert,0,,120.0,80.0,94.0,20.0,36.4,4,Dysuria,4,1000

His vital signs are within normal limits: temperature (36.2°F), heart rate (80 bpm), respiratory rate (20 breaths/min), and blood pressure (130/90 mmHg). He is mentally alert. Given his age and the symptom of dizziness, it is important to consider potential serious underlying conditions, but his stable vital signs and alert mental status suggest that he is not in immediate danger. Therefore, he does not require the highest acuity levels (1 or 2). However, due to his age and the symptom of dizziness, a moderate level of urgency is appropriate.",2,Male,81,17,119 Ambulance,No,dizziness,Alert,0,,130.0,90.0,80.0,20.0,36.2,3,Dizziness and giddiness,3,310

Despite her stable vital signs (temperature: 36.6°F, heart rate: 78 bpm, respiratory rate: 20 breaths/min, blood pressure: 170/100 mmHg) and alert mental status, the nature of her complaint (decreased sensory function) and the suspicion of cord compression necessitate a higher acuity level. Cord compression can lead to significant neurological deficits and requires urgent evaluation and management to prevent irreversible damage.",2,Female,81,2,119 Ambulance,Yes,"Sensory, Decreased",Alert,0,,170.0,100.0,78.0,20.0,36.6,3,"Cord compression, unspecified",3,475
