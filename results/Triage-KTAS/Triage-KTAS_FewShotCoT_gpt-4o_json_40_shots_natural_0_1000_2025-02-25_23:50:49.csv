He is mentally alert. Step 2: Analyze and Compare with Other Patient Cases - Comparing with similar cases, such as the 24-year-old man with a nasal injury (Acuity Level 4) and the 22-year-old woman with acute epigastric pain (Acuity Level 4), both had stable vital signs and were mentally alert. The pain level in this case is lower than in many other cases with Acuity Level 4, but the patient's age and the nature of the injury (ocular) require careful consideration. Step 3: Determine the KTAS acuity level - Given the patient's stable condition, low pain level, and the nature of the injury, the acuity level is likely to be 4, as the condition is not life-threatening and does not require immediate intervention.",2,Male,71,3,Private Vehicle,Yes,right ocular pain,Alert,1,2.0,160.0,100.0,84.0,18.0,36.6,2,Corneal abrasion,4,86

The 68-year-old woman's lower pain level suggests a lower acuity. Step 3: Determine the KTAS acuity level - Given the stable vital signs, low pain level, and the nature of the injury (closed fracture), the acuity level is likely lower than those with higher pain or more severe conditions.

For example, a 77-year-old man with chest pain and acute bronchitis was assigned a level 4, while a 24-year-old man with chest pain and a rib sprain was assigned a level 3.

Step 2: Analyze and Compare with Other Patient Cases - Comparing with other cases, patients with neurological symptoms such as 'confuse mentality' or 'Rt.arm weakness' were assigned acuity levels of 2 or 3, depending on the severity and associated symptoms. The presence of motor weakness and the suspicion of intracranial hemorrhage suggest a higher acuity level.

For example, the 75-year-old man with 'mental change' and multiple trauma was assigned KTAS 1 due to being unresponsive and having hypotension. While this patient is alert, the hypotension and severe pain suggest a need for urgent intervention. Step 3: Determine the KTAS acuity level for this patient based on the examples, KTAS protocol, and your assessment of the patient's clinical presentation - Given the patient's age, severe pain, hypotension, and the potential for serious complications from rib fractures, the patient should be assigned a KTAS acuity level of 2, indicating a high priority for urgent care.",2,Male,74,12,Private Ambulance,Yes,chest wall pain right,Alert,1,8.0,80.0,50.0,98.0,22.0,36.1,1,"Multiple fracture of involving three ribs,Closed",2,207
