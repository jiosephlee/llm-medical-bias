Step 2: Analyze and Compare with Similar Patient Cases - Comparing with other cases, patients with dyspnea and significant vital sign abnormalities, such as low heart rate or low blood pressure, are often assigned a higher acuity level. For example, a patient with dyspnea and a low heart rate or low blood pressure was assigned an acuity level of 2.

Step 2: Analyze and Compare with Similar Patient Cases - In the examples, syncope cases with stable vital signs and alert mental status are generally assigned a KTAS level of 3 or 4. However, the suspected condition of cerebral infarction suggests a higher risk, as it is a serious condition that requires prompt evaluation. Step 3: Determine the KTAS acuity level - Given the patient's stable vital signs and alert mental status, but considering the serious nature of the suspected cerebral infarction, the appropriate KTAS acuity level is 3, indicating a need for urgent evaluation and management.",2,Female,76,8,119 Ambulance,No,syncope,Alert,0,,130.0,80.0,71.0,20.0,36.3,2,"Cerebral infarction, unspecified",2,481
,2,"Step 1: Assess the Patient's Risk - The patient is 78 years old with a chief complaint of general weakness. The vital signs show a low systolic blood pressure of 80 mmHg and a diastolic blood pressure of 50 mmHg, which indicates hypotension. The heart rate is 74 bpm, which is within normal range, but the suspected condition is ventricular tachycardia, a potentially life-threatening arrhythmia. The patient is mentally alert, which is a positive sign, but the combination of hypotension and suspected ventricular tachycardia is concerning. Step 2: Analyze and Compare with Similar Patient Cases - Comparing with other cases, patients with general weakness and hypotension or serious cardiac conditions like ventricular tachycardia are often assigned a higher acuity level. For example, a 79-year-old man with general weakness and high blood pressure was assigned acuity level 2. Step 3: Determine the KTAS acuity level - Given the patient's hypotension and the serious nature of ventricular tachycardia, the acuity level should be high. Based on the examples and the KTAS protocol, this patient should be assigned an acuity level of 2, indicating a high priority for medical intervention.",2,Male,78,8,Private Ambulance,No,G/W-General weakness,Alert,0,,80.0,50.0,74.0,20.0,36.5,2,Ventricular tachycardia,2,589
,3,"Step 1: Assess the Patient's Risk - The patient is 79 years old with a chief complaint of 'mental change'. He is mentally Alert, which indicates he is conscious and responsive. His vital signs are relatively stable: temperature 36.4°F, heart rate 86 bpm, respiratory rate 22 breaths/min, systolic blood pressure 120 mmHg, diastolic blood pressure 80 mmHg. The suspected condition is 'Cerebral infarction due to unspecified occlusion or stenosis of middle cerebral artery', which is a serious condition but the patient is currently alert. Step 2: Analyze and Compare with Similar Patient Cases - Comparing with similar cases, patients with stroke or cerebral infarction who are alert are often assigned a KTAS level of 3. For example, a 52-year-old man with 'rt. side weakness' and suspected stroke was assigned a level 3, and a 66-year-old man with 'Motor weakness' and suspected stroke was also assigned a level 3. Step 3: Determine the KTAS acuity level - Given the patient's alert mental status and stable vital signs, despite the serious nature of the suspected condition, the KTAS acuity level is determined to be 3.",2,Male,79,5,119 Ambulance,No,mental change,Alert,0,,120.0,80.0,86.0,22.0,36.4,2,Cerebral infarction due to unspecified occlusion or stenosis of middle cerebral artery,2,1995
,4,"Step 1: Assess the Patient's Risk - The patient is an 81-year-old man with a chief complaint of dysuria. His vital signs are within normal limits: temperature 36.4°F, heart rate 94 bpm, respiratory rate 20 breaths/min, systolic blood pressure 120 mmHg, diastolic blood pressure 80 mmHg. He is mentally alert, and there is no data on pain. Step 2: Analyze and Compare with Similar Patient Cases - Comparing with similar cases, patients with urinary symptoms like dysuria, voiding difficulty, or urinary retention, who are mentally alert and have stable vital signs, are often assigned a KTAS acuity level of 4. For example, a 56-year-old woman with voiding difficulty and stable vitals was assigned a level 4. Step 3: Determine the KTAS acuity level - Based on the patient's stable vital signs, mental alertness, and the nature of the complaint (dysuria), the appropriate KTAS acuity level is 4, indicating a non-urgent condition that requires minimal resources.",2,Male,81,2,Private Vehicle,No,dysuria,Alert,0,,120.0,80.0,94.0,20.0,36.4,4,Dysuria,4,1000

Vital signs are relatively stable: temperature 36.2°F, heart rate 80 bpm, respiratory rate 20 breaths/min, systolic blood pressure 130 mmHg, diastolic blood pressure 90 mmHg. The patient is mentally alert, which suggests no immediate life-threatening condition. Step 2: Analyze and Compare with Similar Patient Cases - Comparing with similar cases, patients with dizziness and stable vital signs, who are mentally alert, are often assigned a KTAS level of 3 or 4. For instance, a 78-year-old man with dizziness and stable vitals was assigned a level 3, while a 25-year-old woman with dizziness and stable vitals was assigned a level 5. Step 3: Determine the KTAS acuity level - Given the patient's age and stable condition, a KTAS level of 3 is appropriate, as the patient is older and may require more careful monitoring compared to younger patients with similar presentations.",2,Male,81,17,119 Ambulance,No,dizziness,Alert,0,,130.0,90.0,80.0,20.0,36.2,3,Dizziness and giddiness,3,310
,3,"Step 1: Assess the Patient's Risk - The patient is an 81-year-old woman with decreased sensory perception, which could indicate a serious condition such as cord compression. Her vital signs show elevated blood pressure (170/100 mmHg), but her heart rate and respiratory rate are within normal limits. She is mentally alert, which is a positive sign. Step 2: Analyze and Compare with Similar Patient Cases - Comparing with similar cases, such as the 68-year-old woman with motor weakness suspected of transient ischemic attack (Acuity Level 3) and the 73-year-old woman with numbness (Acuity Level 3), both had similar presentations with neurological symptoms and were assigned an acuity level of 3. Step 3: Determine the KTAS acuity level - Given the patient's age, the potential seriousness of cord compression, and the comparison with similar cases, the patient should be assigned an acuity level of 3, indicating a need for urgent evaluation and treatment.",2,Female,81,2,119 Ambulance,Yes,"Sensory, Decreased",Alert,0,,170.0,100.0,78.0,20.0,36.6,3,"Cord compression, unspecified",3,475
,3,"Step 1: Assess the Patient's Risk - The patient is an 87-year-old man with a chief complaint of orthopnea, which is a form of dyspnea that occurs when lying flat and is often associated with heart failure or other serious conditions.

Step 2: Analyze and Compare with Similar Patient Cases - In the examples, patients with dyspnea and stable vital signs, who are mentally alert, are often assigned a KTAS acuity level of 3. However, if there are signs of more severe distress or instability, such as altered mental status or significantly abnormal vital signs, the acuity level may be higher. Step 3: Determine the KTAS acuity level - Given the patient's stable vital signs and alert mental status, but considering the serious nature of orthopnea, which can indicate underlying cardiac issues, the patient is likely to be assigned a KTAS acuity level of 3, indicating a need for urgent but not immediate intervention.",2,Male,87,8,Private Ambulance,No,orthopnea,Alert,0,,150.0,80.0,62.0,20.0,36.2,3,Dyspnoea,3,887
