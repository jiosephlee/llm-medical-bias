Her vital signs are within normal limits: temperature 36.0°F, heart rate 80 bpm, respiratory rate 20 breaths/min, systolic blood pressure 110 mmHg, diastolic blood pressure 70 mmHg. She is mentally alert. The suspected condition is spondylopathy in the lumbar region due to infectious or parasitic diseases. There is no data on pain. Step 2: Analyze and Compare with Similar Patient Cases - Comparing with similar cases, patients with general weakness and normal vital signs, such as the 66-year-old man with dizziness and normal vitals, were assigned an acuity level of 4. The 78-year-old man with general weakness and high blood pressure was assigned a level 4. The 26-year-old man with general weakness and high blood pressure was also assigned a level 4. Step 3: Determine the KTAS acuity level - Given the patient's stable vital signs, alert mental status, and the nature of the suspected condition, the acuity level is likely to be 4, indicating a less urgent need for immediate intervention.",2,Female,67,7,119 Ambulance,No,general weakness,Alert,0,,110.0,70.0,80.0,20.0,36.0,3,"Spondylopathy in other infectious and parasitic diseases classified elsewhere, lumbar region",3,10575

Her vital signs are stable: temperature 36.0°F, heart rate 64 bpm, respiratory rate 20 breaths/min, systolic blood pressure 130 mmHg, diastolic blood pressure 90 mmHg. She is mentally alert. The suspected condition is Transient Global Amnesia, which is generally not life-threatening and often resolves on its own. Step 2: Analyze and Compare with Similar Patient Cases - Comparing with similar cases, such as the 68-year-old woman with 'Motor weakness' suspected of Transient Ischemic Attack (Acuity Level 3) and the 67-year-old woman with 'Dysarthria' suspected of Transient Ischemic Attack (Acuity Level 3), both had stable vital signs and were mentally alert. Step 3: Determine the KTAS acuity level - Given the stable vital signs, mental alertness, and the nature of the suspected condition (Transient Global Amnesia), which is less severe than a Transient Ischemic Attack, the acuity level is likely lower. Therefore, the appropriate KTAS acuity level for this patient is 4.",2,Female,68,12,Private Vehicle,No,Amnesia,Alert,0,,130.0,90.0,64.0,20.0,36.0,3,Transient global amnesia,3,9169

He is mentally alert. Step 2: Analyze and Compare with Similar Patient Cases - Comparing with similar cases, patients with epistaxis and stable vital signs, who are mentally alert, are generally assigned a KTAS level of 3 or 4. For instance, a 73-year-old woman with epistaxis and a blood pressure of 200/100 mmHg was assigned a level 3, while a 58-year-old woman with a blood pressure of 173/97 mmHg was assigned a level 4.

The suspected condition is Cerebrovascular accident NOS. Step 2: Analyze and Compare with Similar Patient Cases - Similar cases with dizziness and suspected stroke or cerebrovascular issues have been assigned an acuity level of 3. For example, a 66-year-old man with motor weakness and suspected stroke was assigned a level 3, and a 59-year-old man with dysarthria and suspected stroke was also assigned a level 3. Step 3: Determine the KTAS acuity level - Based on the examples and the KTAS protocol, the patient's presentation aligns with an acuity level of 3, as the patient is stable, alert, and the condition is serious but not immediately life-threatening.",2,Male,69,5,119 Ambulance,No,dizziness,Alert,0,,150.0,90.0,68.0,20.0,36.8,3,Cerebrovascular accident NOS,3,596

She is mentally alert. The suspected condition is cerebral infarction, unspecified. Step 2: Analyze and Compare with Similar Patient Cases - In the examples, syncope cases with stable vital signs and alert mental status are generally assigned a KTAS level of 3 or 4. However, the presence of a suspected cerebral infarction, even if unspecified, suggests a potentially serious underlying condition. Step 3: Determine the KTAS acuity level - Given the patient's age, the chief complaint of syncope, and the suspicion of cerebral infarction, the acuity level should reflect the need for prompt evaluation and management. Comparing with similar cases, a KTAS level of 3 is appropriate, as it indicates a need for urgent care but not immediate life-saving intervention.",2,Female,76,8,119 Ambulance,No,syncope,Alert,0,,130.0,80.0,71.0,20.0,36.3,2,"Cerebral infarction, unspecified",2,481

The suspected condition is ventricular tachycardia, which is a serious cardiac condition that can lead to hemodynamic instability. Step 2: Analyze and Compare with Similar Patient Cases - Comparing with similar cases, patients with chest pain and low blood pressure or serious cardiac conditions like acute coronary syndrome or heart failure were assigned acuity levels of 2. For example, a 37-year-old man with chest pain, low blood pressure, and high pain level was assigned acuity level 2. Another example is an 82-year-old woman with dyspnea and heart failure, who was also assigned acuity level 2.

His vital signs are relatively stable: temperature 36.4°F, heart rate 86 bpm, respiratory rate 22 breaths/min, systolic blood pressure 120 mmHg, diastolic blood pressure 80 mmHg. The suspected condition is cerebral infarction due to unspecified occlusion or stenosis of the middle cerebral artery, which is a serious condition that can lead to significant morbidity if not treated promptly. Step 2: Analyze and Compare with Similar Patient Cases - Comparing with similar cases, patients with mental changes and suspected stroke or cerebral infarction typically receive a KTAS acuity level of 2 or 3. However, the fact that this patient is mentally alert and has stable vital signs suggests a lower immediate risk compared to those who are unresponsive or have severe vital sign abnormalities.

Step 2: Analyze and Compare with Similar Patient Cases - Comparing with similar cases, patients with urinary issues like voiding difficulty or retention, with stable vital signs and alert mental status, were often assigned acuity levels of 4. For example, a 56-year-old woman with voiding difficulty and stable vitals was assigned a level 4.

Step 2: Analyze and Compare with Similar Patient Cases - Comparing with similar cases, most patients with dizziness and stable vitals, who are mentally alert, are assigned a KTAS acuity level of 3. However, some cases with similar presentations have been assigned a level 5, particularly when the presentation is less concerning and the patient is younger. Step 3: Determine the KTAS acuity level - Given the patient's age and the presentation of dizziness without any alarming vital signs or mental status changes, the acuity level is likely to be 3, as this is consistent with the majority of similar cases where the patient is older and presents with dizziness.",2,Male,81,17,119 Ambulance,No,dizziness,Alert,0,,130.0,90.0,80.0,20.0,36.2,3,Dizziness and giddiness,3,310

The vital signs show hypertension (170/100 mmHg), but the heart rate and respiratory rate are within normal limits. The patient is mentally alert, which is a positive sign. Step 2: Analyze and Compare with Similar Patient Cases - Comparing with similar cases, such as the 73-year-old woman with numbness and the 83-year-old man with dyspnea, both of which were assigned an acuity level of 3, the current case also involves a potentially serious condition (cord compression) and an elderly patient.

Step 2: Analyze and Compare with Similar Patient Cases - Comparing with similar cases, patients with dyspnea and stable vital signs are often assigned a KTAS level of 3. However, given the patient's advanced age and the specific complaint of orthopnea, which can indicate a more serious underlying condition, a higher acuity level may be warranted. Step 3: Determine the KTAS acuity level - Considering the patient's age, the specific nature of the complaint (orthopnea), and the stable but potentially concerning vital signs, the patient should be assigned a KTAS acuity level of 3, indicating a need for urgent evaluation but not immediate life-saving intervention.",2,Male,87,8,Private Ambulance,No,orthopnea,Alert,0,,150.0,80.0,62.0,20.0,36.2,3,Dyspnoea,3,887
