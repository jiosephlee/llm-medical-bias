Step 2: Analyze and Compare with Similar Patient Cases - Comparing with similar cases, patients with fractures, especially of major bones like the femur, are typically assigned a KTAS acuity level of 4. However, the extremely high blood pressure is concerning and could warrant a higher acuity level. Step 3: Determine the KTAS acuity level - Given the significant injury and the very high blood pressure, which could indicate a risk of further complications, the patient should be assigned a KTAS acuity level of 3 to ensure timely intervention and monitoring.",2,Female,81,5,Private Ambulance,Yes,Left leg pain,Alert,1,4.0,200.0,160.0,80.0,20.0,36.0,3,"Closed, fracture of shaft of femur",4,185

A 24-year-old woman with leg pain and a pain level of 8 was assigned acuity level 3. A 42-year-old woman with knee bleeding and a pain level of 3 was assigned acuity level 3. Step 3: Determine the KTAS acuity level - The patient's pain level is higher than the 44-year-old man with a pain level of 5 (acuity 4) but lower than the 24-year-old woman with a pain level of 8 (acuity 3). Given the pain level of 6 and the fact that the patient is alert and vitals are stable, the acuity level is likely 4, as the pain is significant but not as severe as the case with acuity level 3.",2,Male,29,3,Private Vehicle,No,knee pain,Alert,1,6.0,110.0,70.0,88.0,20.0,36.4,3,"Pain in limb, knee joint",4,34

Step 2: Analyze and Compare with Similar Patient Cases - Comparing with the examples, patients with headaches and high pain levels or significant underlying conditions (e.g., suspected subdural hemorrhage) tend to be assigned higher acuity levels. For instance, a 32-year-old man with a headache and pain level of 8 was assigned acuity level 2. The current patient has a potentially serious condition (subdural hemorrhage) but is alert and has stable vital signs. Step 3: Determine the KTAS acuity level - Given the suspicion of a traumatic subdural hemorrhage, which is a serious condition, and the patient's stable vital signs and alert mental status, the acuity level should reflect the need for urgent evaluation but not immediate life-saving intervention.

For example, a 25-year-old man with chest pain, a heart rate of 114 bpm, and stable blood pressure was assigned a level 3. However, older patients with similar presentations and a suspicion of ischemic chest pain were often assigned a level 2. Step 3: Determine the KTAS acuity level - Given the patient's age, stable vital signs, and the suspicion of ischemic chest pain, the acuity level should be higher than 3 due to the potential severity of the condition.

For instance, a 71-year-old woman with 'L side weakness' and a suspected stroke was assigned acuity level 2, while a 66-year-old man with 'Motor weakness' and suspected stroke was assigned acuity level 3. The key difference is the severity of symptoms and the patient's mental status. Step 3: Determine the KTAS acuity level - Given the patient's age, the presence of right hemiparesis, and the suspected cerebral infarction, the situation is serious but not immediately life-threatening as the patient is alert.

The 36-year-old woman with an 'eye injury' and suspected subconjunctival hemorrhage was also assigned a KTAS level of 4. Both cases involved eye-related issues with stable vital signs and no immediate life-threatening conditions. Step 3: Determine the KTAS acuity level - Given the stable vital signs, the nature of the injury (corneal abrasion), and the comparison with similar cases, the patient's condition is non-urgent and does not require immediate intervention.

His vital signs are stable: temperature 36.4°F, heart rate 94 bpm, respiratory rate 20 breaths/min, blood pressure 120/80 mmHg, and he is mentally alert. There is no indication of severe distress or life-threatening condition. Step 2: Analyze and Compare with Similar Patient Cases - Comparing with similar cases, such as those with urinary symptoms like voiding difficulty or urinary retention, most of these cases were assigned an acuity level of 4. The patient's stable vital signs and alert mental status suggest a non-urgent condition. Step 3: Determine the KTAS acuity level - Based on the examples and the patient's stable condition, the appropriate KTAS acuity level is 4, indicating a non-urgent condition requiring minimal resources.",2,Male,81,2,Private Vehicle,No,dysuria,Alert,0,,120.0,80.0,94.0,20.0,36.4,4,Dysuria,4,1000
,3,"Step 1: Assess the Patient's Risk - The patient is 81 years old, presenting with dizziness and giddiness. His vital signs are relatively stable: temperature 36.2°F, heart rate 80 bpm, respiratory rate 20 breaths/min, systolic blood pressure 130 mmHg, diastolic blood pressure 90 mmHg. He is mentally alert. Step 2: Analyze and Compare with Similar Patient Cases - Comparing with similar cases, older patients with dizziness and stable vital signs are often assigned an acuity level of 3. For example, an 81-year-old woman with similar symptoms and stable vitals was assigned a level 3. Step 3: Determine the KTAS acuity level - Given the patient's age, symptoms, and stable vital signs, the acuity level is determined to be 3, as it aligns with similar cases where patients are older and present with dizziness but have stable vital signs.",2,Male,81,17,119 Ambulance,No,dizziness,Alert,0,,130.0,90.0,80.0,20.0,36.2,3,Dizziness and giddiness,3,310
,2,"Step 1: Assess the Patient's Risk - The patient is an 81-year-old woman with a chief complaint of 'Sensory, Decreased' and is suspected to have cord compression, which can be a serious condition. Her vital signs are relatively stable, but her blood pressure is elevated (170/100 mmHg). She is mentally alert, and there is no data on pain. Step 2: Analyze and Compare with Similar Patient Cases - Comparing with similar cases, the 73-year-old woman with 'numbness' and stable vitals was assigned a KTAS level of 3. The 42-year-old woman with 'left side weakness' and missing data was assigned a KTAS level of 2, likely due to the potential severity of the condition. Step 3: Determine the KTAS acuity level - Given the potential severity of cord compression and the patient's age, a KTAS level of 2 is appropriate to ensure timely evaluation and management.",2,Female,81,2,119 Ambulance,Yes,"Sensory, Decreased",Alert,0,,170.0,100.0,78.0,20.0,36.6,3,"Cord compression, unspecified",3,475
,3,"Step 1: Assess the Patient's Risk - The patient is an 87-year-old man with a chief complaint of orthopnea, which is a form of dyspnea that occurs when lying flat. His vital signs are relatively stable: temperature 36.2°F, heart rate 62 bpm, respiratory rate 20 breaths/min, systolic blood pressure 150 mmHg, diastolic blood pressure 80 mmHg, and he is mentally alert. Step 2: Analyze and Compare with Similar Patient Cases - Comparing with similar cases, patients with dyspnea and stable vital signs, such as the 83-year-old woman with dyspnea and stable vitals, were assigned an acuity level of 3. However, the presence of orthopnea, which can indicate more severe underlying conditions like heart failure, may warrant a higher acuity level. Step 3: Determine the KTAS acuity level - Given the patient's age, the presence of orthopnea, and the comparison with similar cases, the patient should be assigned an acuity level of 3, indicating a need for urgent evaluation but not immediate life-saving intervention.",2,Male,87,8,Private Ambulance,No,orthopnea,Alert,0,,150.0,80.0,62.0,20.0,36.2,3,Dyspnoea,3,887
