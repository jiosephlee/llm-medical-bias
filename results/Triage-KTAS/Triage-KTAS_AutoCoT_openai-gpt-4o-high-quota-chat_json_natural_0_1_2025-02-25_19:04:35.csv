He has temperature of 36.6°F, heart rate of 84.0 bpm, respiratory rate of 18.0 breaths/min, systolic blood pressure of 160.0 mmHg, diastolic blood pressure of 100.0 mmHg, and reports pain with a level of 2.0. He is mentally Alert. The patient is suspected to have Corneal abrasion.""}",4,"The patient is a 71-year-old man presenting with right ocular pain, suspected to be due to a corneal abrasion. His vital signs are within normal limits: temperature 36.6°F, heart rate 84 bpm, respiratory rate 18 breaths/min, and blood pressure 160/100 mmHg. He reports a pain level of 2, which is mild. He is mentally alert. Corneal abrasions, while painful, are generally not life-threatening and do not typically require immediate intervention unless there are complications such as infection or significant vision loss. Given the patient's stable vital signs, mild pain, and alert mental status, the acuity level is determined to be low.",2,Male,71,3,Private Vehicle,Yes,right ocular pain,Alert,1,2.0,160.0,100.0,84.0,18.0,36.6,2,Corneal abrasion,4,86

Her vital signs are within normal limits except for a slightly elevated heart rate (102 bpm). She is mentally alert and reports a pain level of 2, which is mild.
