Can someone here write me a prescription?” requests a 56-year-old male with a history of HTN. Vital signs: BP 128/84, HR 76, RR 16, T 97˚F.'}",5,"Step 1: Assess the Patient's Risk & Resource Needs - The patient is a 56-year-old male with a history of hypertension (HTN) who has run out of his blood pressure medication. His vital signs are within normal limits: BP 128/84, HR 76, RR 16, T 97˚F. There is no immediate risk to the patient's life or limb, and he does not require any immediate intervention. Step 2: Analyze and Compare with Other Patient Cases - Comparing this case to the examples, the patient is similar to the 13-year-old male who ran out of ADHD medication and was assigned an ESI level of 5. Both cases involve patients who are stable and require minimal resources, primarily a prescription refill. Step 3: Determine the ESI acuity level for this patient based on the examples and your assessment of the patient's clinical presentation - The patient is stable, with no immediate risk factors or need for emergency intervention. The primary need is a prescription refill, which is a minimal resource requirement. Therefore, the appropriate ESI acuity level is 5.","“I ran out of my blood pressure medicine, and my doctor is on vacation. Can someone here write me a prescription?” requests a 56-year-old male with a history of HTN. Vital signs: BP 128/84, HR 76, RR 16, T 97˚F.","ESI level  5: No resources. The patient needs  a prescription refill and has no other medical complaints. His blood pressure is controlled with his current medication. If at triage his blood pressure was 188/124 and he complained of a headache,, then he would meet the criteria for a high-risk situation and be assigned to ESI level 2. If this patient’s BP was elevated and the patient had no complaints, he or she would remain an ESI level 5. The blood pressure would be repeated and would most likely not be  treated in the ED or treated with PO medications.",5
,3,"Step 1: Assess the Patient's Risk & Resource Needs - The patient is a 41-year-old male who was involved in a bicycle accident. He is ambulatory and walked into the emergency department, indicating he is stable. He has his right arm in a sling and is complaining of wrist pain, suggesting a possible fracture or sprain. There is also a 2-centimeter laceration on his left elbow. He is not exhibiting any life-threatening symptoms such as altered mental status, severe bleeding, or respiratory distress. Step 2: Analyze and Compare with Other Patient Cases - Comparing this case to the examples, the patient is similar to the 19-year-old male involved in a bicycle accident with a laceration and clavicle pain, which was assigned an ESI level of 3. The patient does not require immediate life-saving intervention (ESI 1) or high-risk intervention (ESI 2). The patient will likely need an X-ray to assess the wrist injury and wound care for the laceration, which aligns with ESI level 3, where multiple resources are needed. Step 3: Determine the ESI acuity level for this patient based on the examples and your assessment of the patient's clinical presentation - Based on the assessment and comparison, the patient is stable, requires multiple resources, and does not have high-risk features, thus an ESI level of 3 is appropriate.","A 41-year-old male involved in a bicycle accident walks into the emergency department with his right arm in a sling. He tells you that he fell off his bike and landed on his right arm. His is complaining of pain in the wrist area and has a 2-centimeter laceration on his left elbow. “My helmet saved me,” he tells you.","ESI level 3: Two or more resources. At a minimum, this patient will require an x ray of his right arm and suturing of his left elbow laceration.",3
,2,"Step 1: Assess the Patient's Risk & Resource Needs - The patient is experiencing shortness of breath with a respiratory rate of 32, which is elevated. Her SpO2 is 93% on room air, indicating mild hypoxemia. She is a smoker, which could contribute to respiratory issues. Her heart rate and blood pressure are within normal limits, and she has no significant past medical history or allergies. Step 2: Analyze and Compare with Other Patient Cases - Compared to the examples, this patient does not require immediate life-saving intervention (ESI 1) as her vital signs are relatively stable. However, her respiratory distress and hypoxemia suggest she may need more than one resource, such as oxygen therapy and further diagnostic testing (e.g., chest X-ray, blood tests) to determine the cause of her symptoms. This is similar to cases where patients had significant symptoms but were not in immediate danger, such as the 7-year-old hit by a car (ESI 1) or the restrained driver in a car accident (ESI 2). Step 3: Determine the ESI acuity level for this patient based on the examples and your assessment of the patient's clinical presentation - Given her respiratory distress and the likelihood of needing multiple resources, the patient is best categorized as ESI 2.","A 32-year-old female presents to the emergency department complaining of shortness of breath for several hours. No past medical history, +smoker. Vital signs: RR 32, HR 96, BP 126/80, SpO2 93% on room air, T 98.6˚F.

She is a smoker and is exhibiting signs and symptoms of respiratory distress (SpO2 and respiratory rate.) Based on history and signs and symptoms, a pulmonary embolus, as well as other potential causes for her respiratory distress, must be ruled out.",2
,3,"Step 1: Assess the Patient's Risk & Resource Needs - The patient is a 60-year-old man with a painful, red, warm, swollen, and tender right foot. He has a history of type 2 diabetes and psoriasis. His vital signs are stable, with a slightly elevated temperature of 99.4˚F, which may indicate a mild infection or inflammation. There is no immediate life-threatening condition or need for life-saving intervention. The patient will likely require diagnostic tests such as blood work or imaging to determine the cause of the symptoms, possibly indicating an infection or gout. Step 2: Analyze and Compare with Other Patient Cases - Comparing this case to the examples, the patient does not exhibit signs of severe distress or instability that would warrant an ESI level of 1 or 2. The condition is more complex than a simple laceration or minor injury, which would be ESI level 4 or 5. The need for diagnostic resources aligns more closely with ESI level 3. Step 3: Determine the ESI acuity level for this patient based on the examples and your assessment of the patient's clinical presentation - Given the need for diagnostic evaluation and the patient's stable condition, the appropriate ESI level is 3.","A 60-year-old man requests to see a doctor because his right foot hurts. On exam the great toe and foot skin is red, warm, swollen, and tender to touch. He denies injury. past medical history includes type 2 diabetes, and psoriasis.

,4,"Step 1: Assess the Patient's Risk & Resource Needs - The patient is a 52-year-old female with symptoms suggestive of a urinary tract infection (UTI), such as dysuria and frequency. She denies abdominal pain or vaginal discharge, which suggests the infection is likely uncomplicated. Her vital signs are stable, and she has no significant past medical history or allergies. Step 2: Analyze and Compare with Other Patient Cases - Comparing this case to the examples, the patient with a laceration from a bagel cut (Acuity Level 4) and the patient with sawdust in the eye (Acuity Level 4) both have minor issues that require minimal resources. The patient with a rusty nail injury (Acuity Level 5) and the child with vomiting but well-hydrated (Acuity Level 5) have conditions that are non-urgent and require minimal resources. Step 3: Determine the ESI acuity level for this patient based on the examples and your assessment of the patient's clinical presentation - The patient's condition is non-urgent, and she is stable with no immediate risk. The resources needed are likely minimal, such as a urinalysis and possibly antibiotics. Therefore, the appropriate ESI acuity level is 4.","A 52-year-old female requests to see a doctor for a possible urinary tract infection (UTI). She is complaining of dysuria and frequency. She denies abdominal pain or vaginal discharge. No allergies, takes vitamins, and has no significant past medical history. Vital signs: T 97.4˚F, HR 78, RR 14, BP 142/70.","ESI level 4: One resource. She will need one resource – lab, which will include a urinalysis and urine culture. She most likely has a UTI that will be treated with oral medications.",4

This history sounds more like pneumonia. Because the patient is not in acute respiratory distress, he or she doesn’t meet ESI level-2 criteria. This patient will require labs, a chest x ray, and perhaps IV antibiotics.",3
,4,"Step 1: Assess the Patient's Risk & Resource Needs - The patient is a 33-year-old female with symptoms of vomiting and diarrhea, likely due to food poisoning. Her vital signs are stable: temperature is slightly below normal, heart rate is slightly elevated but not concerning, respiratory rate and blood pressure are normal. She reports abdominal cramping with a pain level of 5/10. There are no signs of dehydration or severe distress. Step 2: Analyze and Compare with Other Patient Cases - Comparing with other cases, such as the 6-year-old with a laceration (ESI 4) and the 36-year-old with sawdust in the eye (ESI 4), this patient has a similar level of acuity. The symptoms are uncomfortable but not life-threatening, and the patient is stable. Step 3: Determine the ESI acuity level - Based on the assessment and comparison, the patient requires minimal resources and is not in immediate danger, indicating an ESI level of 4.","“I think I have food poisoning,” reports an otherwise healthy 33-year-old female. “I have been vomiting all night, and now I have diarrhea.” The patient admits to abdominal cramping that she rates as 5/10.

,3,"Step 1: Assess the Patient's Risk & Resource Needs - The patient is a 27-year-old female who is 7 weeks pregnant and experiencing persistent vomiting, leading to potential dehydration. Her vital signs show a slightly elevated heart rate (HR 104), which could be indicative of dehydration. Her blood pressure is within normal limits, and she is afebrile with normal oxygen saturation. The primary concern is dehydration due to hyperemesis gravidarum, which may require IV fluids for rehydration. Step 2: Analyze and Compare with Other Patient Cases - Comparing with other cases, such as the 8-month-old with fever, cough, and vomiting (Acuity Level 2), and the 7-year-old with a stomach ache and vomiting (Acuity Level 3), this patient is more stable than the 8-month-old but may require more resources than the 7-year-old. Step 3: Determine the ESI acuity level - The patient is not in immediate danger and does not require life-saving intervention, ruling out ESI 1. She is likely to need more than one resource (e.g., IV fluids, possibly lab tests), which suggests an ESI level of 3. However, she is not in severe distress or at high risk, so ESI 2 is not appropriate.","“I’m 7 weeks pregnant, and every time I try to eat something, I throw up,” reports a 27-year- old female. “My doctor sent me to the emergency department because he thinks I am getting dehydrated.

,1,"Step 1: Assess the Patient's Risk & Resource Needs - The patient is an 84-year-old male who passed out and was found to be in a third-degree heart block with a very low heart rate and blood pressure. This condition is life-threatening and requires immediate intervention. The paramedics have already started external pacing, which is a critical intervention to stabilize the patient's heart rate and blood pressure. Step 2: Analyze and Compare with Other Patient Cases - Comparing this case to the examples, patients with life-threatening conditions requiring immediate interventions, such as the 21-year-old female with a rapid heart rate and low blood pressure, and the 17-year-old with a gunshot wound and low blood pressure, were both assigned an ESI level of 1. Step 3: Determine the ESI acuity level for this patient based on the examples and your assessment of the patient's clinical presentation - Given the patient's critical condition and the need for immediate life-saving intervention, the appropriate ESI acuity level is 1.","“This 84-year-old male passed out in the bathroom,” reports  the local paramedics. “When we arrived he was in a third-degree  heart block with a rate in the 20s and a blood pressure in the 60s.

Her vital signs are relatively stable, with a slight fever (T 100.8˚F) and normal heart rate (HR 92), respiratory rate (RR 20), blood pressure (BP 118/80), and oxygen saturation (SpO2 99%). The pain is moderate (5/10). The clinical presentation suggests a potential post-abortion complication, such as infection, which requires medical evaluation and possibly antibiotics or further intervention. Step 2: Analyze and Compare with Other Patient Cases - Comparing with other cases, this patient does not require immediate life-saving intervention (ESI 1) or high-risk intervention (ESI 2). The situation is more urgent than a simple laceration or minor injury (ESI 4 or 5) but less critical than cases involving severe trauma or altered mental status. Step 3: Determine the ESI acuity level - Given the potential for infection and the need for medical evaluation and possible treatment, the patient requires more than one resource but is not in immediate danger. This aligns with ESI level 3, where the patient needs prompt evaluation and treatment but is not in a high-risk category.","A-25-year-old  female  presented  to  the emergency department  because  of  moderate lower abdominal pain with a  fever  and  chills.

She reports pain but no vision loss, and her vital signs are normal. There are no signs of trauma to the globe, only redness and swelling in the periorbital area. The patient denies loss of consciousness. This suggests that the injury is not life-threatening and does not require immediate intervention. Step 2: Analyze and Compare with Other Patient Cases - Comparing this case to the example of the 36-year-old male with sawdust in his eye (Acuity Level 4), both cases involve eye injuries with normal vital signs and no immediate threat to vision or life. Step 3: Determine the ESI acuity level - Based on the assessment and comparison, the patient's condition is non-urgent and likely requires minimal resources, such as an eye examination and possibly pain management. Therefore, the appropriate ESI acuity level is 4.","“I was at a family reunion, and we were playing baseball. One of my nephews hit the ball so hard, and I tried to catch it, missed, and it hit me right in the eye. My vision is fine. It just hurts,” reports a 34-year-old healthy female. Vital signs are within normal limits. There are no obvious signs of trauma to the globe, only redness and swelling in the periorbital area.

Therefore, the appropriate ESI level is 5.","“I think I need a tetanus shot,” a 29-year-old female tells you. “I stepped on a rusty nail this morning, and I know I haven’t had one for years.” No past medical history, No known drug allergies, no medications.",ESI level 5: No resources. A tetanus immunization does not count as a resource. The patient will be seen by a physician or midlevel provider and receive a tetanus immunization and discharge instructions. This patient will require no resources.,5
,2,"Step 1: Assess the Patient's Risk & Resource Needs - The patient is a 63-year-old male who is cachectic and usually unresponsive, indicating a high level of baseline medical complexity. The immediate issue is that his feeding tube has fallen out, which is a significant concern as it is his primary means of nutrition. However, there is no indication of immediate life-threatening conditions such as compromised airway, breathing, or circulation. Step 2: Analyze and Compare with Other Patient Cases - Comparing with other cases, this situation is similar to cases where patients have a significant medical need but are not in immediate danger, such as the patient with a swollen hand in a cast (Acuity Level 2) or the 8-month-old with fever and vomiting (Acuity Level 2). Step 3: Determine the ESI acuity level - Given the patient's need for medical intervention to replace the feeding tube and his overall medical condition, he requires prompt attention but not immediate life-saving intervention. Therefore, the appropriate ESI acuity level is 2.",A 63-year-old cachectic male is brought in from the local nursing  home because his feeding tube fell out again. The patient is usually unresponsive. He has been in the nursing home since he suffered a massive stroke about 4 years ago.,"ESI level 4: One  resource. This patient  will be sent back to the nursing home after the feeding tube is reinserted. There is no acute change in his medical condition that warrants any further evaluation. He is unresponsive, but that is the patient’s baseline mental status so he is not an ESI level 1.",4
,2,"Step 1: Assess the Patient's Risk & Resource Needs - The patient has a known severe shellfish allergy and experienced throat closure, a sign of anaphylaxis, which is a potentially life-threatening condition. Although he used his EpiPen and currently feels okay, the risk of biphasic anaphylaxis (a second wave of symptoms) exists. Monitoring and possibly additional treatment are necessary. Step 2: Analyze and Compare with Other Patient Cases - Comparing with other cases, patients with potential life-threatening conditions, even if currently stable, are often assigned a higher acuity level. For example, the patient with a gunshot wound was assigned ESI 1 due to the potential for rapid deterioration. Step 3: Determine the ESI acuity level - Given the potential for rapid deterioration and the need for monitoring and possible intervention, this patient should be assigned an ESI level that reflects the need for immediate attention and monitoring.","A 28-year-old male presents to the ED requesting to be checked. He has a severe shellfish allergy and mistakenly ate a dip that contained shrimp. He immediately felt his throat start to close, so he used his EpiPen. He tells you that he feels okay.

,4,"Step 1: Assess the Patient's Risk & Resource Needs - The 19-month-old has a 2-centimeter lip laceration that extends through the vermilion border. The vital signs are within normal limits for age, indicating no immediate life-threatening condition. The primary concern is the laceration, which may require suturing, especially since it involves the vermilion border, which is cosmetically significant. Step 2: Analyze and Compare with Other Patient Cases - Comparing with the example of the 6-year-old with a 3-centimeter knee laceration (Acuity Level 4), this case is similar in that it involves a laceration but differs due to the involvement of the vermilion border, which may require more precise repair. Step 3: Determine the ESI acuity level - Given the need for potential suturing and the cosmetic importance of the vermilion border, this case is more resource-intensive than a simple laceration but does not involve high-risk or life-threatening conditions. Therefore, the appropriate ESI level is 4.","“He was running after his brother, fell, and cut his lip on the corner of the coffee table. There was blood everywhere,” recalls the mother of a healthy 19-month-old. “He’ll never stay still for the doctor.” You notice that the baby has a 2- centimeter lip laceration that extends through the vermilion border. Vital signs are within normal limits for age.","ESI level 3: Two or more resources. A laceration through the vermilion border requires the physician to line up the edges exactly. Misalignment can be noticeable. A healthy 19-month-old will probably not cooperate. In most settings, he will require conscious sedation, which counts as two resources. The toddler’s vital signs are within normal limits for his age, so there is no reason to up-triage to ESI level 2.",3
,2,"Step 1: Assess the Patient's Risk & Resource Needs - The patient is a 44-year-old female with continuous retching and a history of diabetes. She has been vomiting for 5 hours and has not taken her insulin, which poses a risk for diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). Her vital signs show tachycardia (P 126) and tachypnea (RR 24), indicating potential dehydration or metabolic imbalance. Step 2: Analyze and Compare with Other Patient Cases - Comparing with other cases, such as the 8-month-old with fever and vomiting (Acuity Level 2) and the 17-year-old with a gunshot wound (Acuity Level 1), this patient is at risk of a serious condition due to her diabetes and prolonged vomiting. However, she is not in immediate life-threatening distress like the ESI Level 1 cases. Step 3: Determine the ESI acuity level - Given the risk of DKA and the need for multiple resources (IV fluids, insulin management, possible lab tests), this patient requires urgent care but not immediate life-saving intervention, placing her at ESI Level 2.","A 44-year-old female is retching continuously into a large basin as her son wheels her into the triage area.

He was found on the bathroom floor with maroon-colored stool, indicating a possible gastrointestinal bleed. His vital signs are concerning: BP 70/palp (indicating hypotension), HR 128 (tachycardia), and RR 40 (tachypnea). These signs suggest he is in shock, likely due to significant blood loss. Immediate intervention is required to stabilize his condition. Step 2: Analyze and Compare with Other Patient Cases - Comparing with other cases, such as the 17-year-old with a gunshot wound and hypotension (Acuity Level 1), this patient also presents with life-threatening vital signs and requires immediate intervention. Step 3: Determine the ESI acuity level for this patient based on the examples and your assessment of the patient's clinical presentation - Given the patient's critical condition, hypotension, tachycardia, and the need for immediate life-saving interventions, the appropriate ESI acuity level is 1.","EMS arrives with a 76-year-old male found on the bathroom floor.

His vital signs show a slightly elevated heart rate (HR 112), which can be a sign of dehydration, but his blood pressure is normal (BP 120/80), and his oxygen saturation is 100%. His temperature is normal (T 98°F). The dry and cracked lips further suggest dehydration. Step 2: Analyze and Compare with Other Patient Cases - Comparing with other cases, the patient does not require immediate life-saving intervention (ESI 1) or high-risk interventions (ESI 2). The symptoms suggest a need for some resources, such as IV fluids for rehydration, but not multiple complex resources. This is similar to cases where patients had fractures or lacerations requiring some medical attention but not immediate life-saving measures. Step 3: Determine the ESI acuity level for this patient based on the examples and your assessment of the patient's clinical presentation - The patient is likely to need IV fluids and possibly some lab tests, which aligns with an ESI level of 3, where the patient is stable but requires more than one resource.","I think I picked up a bug overseas,” reports a 34-year-old male who presented in the emergency department complaining of frequent watery stools and abdominal cramping. “I think I am getting dehydrated.” T 98°F, RR 22, HR 112, BP 120/80, SpO2 100%.

He lanced it yesterday and packed some stuff in it. He said he just want to make sure it is healing OK,” reports a 54-year-old diabetic male. The patient goes on to tell you that he feels so much better. T 98°F, RR 16, HR 64, BP 142/78, SpO2 98%. Pain 2/10.","ESI level 5: No resources. This patient was instructed to come back to the emergency department for a wound check. He will be examined and discharged to home. No resources are required. A point-of-care finger stick glucose is indicated, but this is not a resource. If the patient came back with a fever or increasing pain and redness, then his ESI level would reflect the additional resources he would require.",5
,3,"Step 1: Assess the Patient's Risk & Resource Needs - The patient is a 43-year-old female with a history of asthma, presenting with wheezing and fever. Her rescue inhaler is not providing relief, indicating a potential exacerbation of asthma. Vital signs show a fever (T 101.4°F), elevated respiratory rate (RR 26), normal heart rate (HR 90), normal blood pressure (BP 138/70), and slightly reduced oxygen saturation (SpO2 95%). The patient is not in immediate life-threatening distress, as her SpO2 is above 90%, but she does require medical intervention to manage her asthma exacerbation. Step 2: Analyze and Compare with Other Patient Cases - Comparing with other cases, this patient is similar to the 7-year-old with a stomach ache and vomiting (Acuity Level 3) and the 19-year-old with a bicycle accident (Acuity Level 3), both of whom required medical intervention but were not in immediate life-threatening distress. Step 3: Determine the ESI acuity level for this patient based on the examples and your assessment of the patient's clinical presentation - The patient requires medical intervention for asthma exacerbation, but is not in immediate life-threatening distress. Therefore, the appropriate ESI acuity level is 3.","“I have been wheezing for a few days, and  today I woke up with a fever.

,2,"Step 1: Assess the Patient's Risk & Resource Needs - The patient is a 56-year-old male with a sudden loss of vision in one eye lasting 5 minutes. He has a history of hypertension and high cholesterol, which are risk factors for vascular events. Sudden vision loss could indicate a transient ischemic attack (TIA) or retinal artery occlusion, both of which require prompt evaluation. Step 2: Analyze and Compare with Other Patient Cases - Comparing with other cases, this presentation is more concerning than minor injuries or non-urgent conditions (ESI 4 or 5) but does not require immediate life-saving intervention (ESI 1). It is similar to cases where patients have potential serious conditions that need urgent evaluation (ESI 2). Step 3: Determine the ESI acuity level - Given the potential for a serious underlying condition and the need for urgent diagnostic evaluation, the appropriate ESI level is 2.","“I was having breakfast with my wife, and all of a sudden I couldn’t see out of my right eye. It lasted about 5 minutes. I’m just scared because I’ve never had anything like this happen  before,” reports a 56-year-old male with a history of HTN and high cholesterol.","ESI level 2: High risk. This patient is exhibiting signs of central retinal artery occlusion, which represents an acute threat to loss of vision. Rapid evaluation is necessary.",2
,4,"Step 1: Assess the Patient's Risk & Resource Needs - The patient is a 43-year-old female who twisted her ankle. She reports significant pain (8/10) but has stable vital signs and no immediate life-threatening conditions. The primary concern is pain management and potential imaging to rule out a fracture. Step 2: Analyze and Compare with Other Patient Cases - Comparing with other cases, such as the 14-year-old male with a leg deformity (Acuity Level 3) and the 19-year-old male with a clavicle injury (Acuity Level 3), this patient does not have an obvious deformity or high-risk mechanism of injury. The case is more similar to the 6-year-old with a knee laceration (Acuity Level 4) or the 36-year-old with sawdust in the eye (Acuity Level 4), where the primary need is pain management and possibly imaging. Step 3: Determine the ESI acuity level for this patient - Based on the assessment, the patient requires evaluation and possibly an X-ray to rule out a fracture, but there is no immediate threat to life or limb. Therefore, the appropriate ESI level is 4.","“I was walking down the street and twisted my ankle as I stepped off the curb. I don’t think it’s broken, but it hurts so much,” report a 43-year- old female with a history of colitis. Vital signs:  T 98°F, HR 72, RR 18, BP 134/80, SpO2 100%. Pain 8/10.","ESI level 4: One resource. To rule out a fracture, this patient will require an x ray, one resource. The application of a splint and crutch walking instructions are not counted as resources. This patient does not meet the criteria for ESI level 2 for pain because nursing can immediately initiate interventions to address her pain.",4
,3,"Step 1: Assess the Patient's Risk & Resource Needs - The patient is a 26-year-old female with a known history of colitis, experiencing increased bowel movements and cramping. Her vital signs are stable: T 97°F, RR 18, HR 68, BP 112/76, SpO2 100%. She reports pain at 6/10. There is no indication of immediate life-threatening conditions or need for immediate intervention.

,3,"Step 1: Assess the Patient's Risk & Resource Needs - The patient is a 54-year-old male on blood thinners with pain and swelling in the lower leg, which could indicate a possible deep vein thrombosis (DVT). While the patient is on medication to prevent clots, the symptoms suggest a potential complication that requires further investigation. However, the patient is hemodynamically stable with vital signs within normal limits and denies other complaints. Step 2: Analyze and Compare with Other Patient Cases - Comparing with other cases, such as the 14-year-old with a leg deformity (Acuity Level 3) and the 19-year-old with a clavicle injury (Acuity Level 3), this patient also requires diagnostic testing (e.g., ultrasound) to confirm DVT and possibly adjust medication. Step 3: Determine the ESI acuity level - The patient is stable and does not require immediate life-saving intervention, but does need more than one resource for diagnosis and treatment. Therefore, the appropriate ESI level is 3.","“I take a blood thinner because I have had clots in my legs,” reports a 54-year-old black male. “They told me that medicine would prevent them, but today I have pain and swelling in my lower leg. It started out just being sore, but now I can hardly walk on it.” Denies any other complaints. Vital signs within normal limits.",ESI level 3: Two or more resources.
