His vital signs are within normal limits: blood pressure is 128/84, heart rate is 76, respiratory rate is 16, and temperature is 97°F. There are no signs of acute distress or life-threatening conditions. The patient does not require immediate life-saving intervention, and his condition is stable. He is seeking a prescription refill, which is an administrative request rather than a medical emergency. The patient is unlikely to require any diagnostic tests or complex interventions. Therefore, the situation is non-urgent and requires minimal resources.","“I ran out of my blood pressure medicine, and my doctor is on vacation. Can someone here write me a prescription?” requests a 56-year-old male with a history of HTN. Vital signs: BP 128/84, HR 76, RR 16, T 97˚F.","ESI level  5: No resources. The patient needs  a prescription refill and has no other medical complaints. His blood pressure is controlled with his current medication. If at triage his blood pressure was 188/124 and he complained of a headache,, then he would meet the criteria for a high-risk situation and be assigned to ESI level 2. If this patient’s BP was elevated and the patient had no complaints, he or she would remain an ESI level 5. The blood pressure would be repeated and would most likely not be  treated in the ED or treated with PO medications.",5
,3,"The patient is a 41-year-old male who was involved in a bicycle accident. He is ambulatory and walked into the emergency department, indicating that he is stable and does not require immediate life-saving intervention, ruling out ESI level 1. He is complaining of pain in the wrist area and has a 2-centimeter laceration on his left elbow. The laceration may require sutures, and the wrist pain suggests a possible fracture, which would require an X-ray for diagnosis. The patient is not in severe distress, and there is no indication of a high-risk situation such as altered mental status or severe hemorrhage, which rules out ESI level 2. The patient will likely need more than one resource (e.g., X-ray, possible suturing, and pain management), which suggests an ESI level of 3. ESI level 4 and 5 are not appropriate as they are for cases requiring one or no resources, respectively.","A 41-year-old male involved in a bicycle accident walks into the emergency department with his right arm in a sling.

At a minimum, this patient will require an x ray of his right arm and suturing of his left elbow laceration.",3
,2,"The patient is a 32-year-old female presenting with shortness of breath, which is a concerning symptom that requires careful evaluation. Her respiratory rate is elevated at 32 breaths per minute, indicating respiratory distress. Her oxygen saturation is 93% on room air, which is below the normal range and suggests hypoxemia. Although her heart rate and blood pressure are within normal limits, the combination of tachypnea and low oxygen saturation suggests a potential need for immediate intervention to prevent further deterioration. According to the ESI algorithm, we first assess whether the patient requires immediate life-saving intervention. While she is not in immediate danger of losing her airway or requiring CPR, her respiratory status is compromised. Therefore, she does not meet the criteria for ESI level 1. Next, we consider if she is a high-risk situation, which would classify her as ESI level 2. Given her respiratory distress and hypoxemia, she is at high risk for further deterioration and likely requires immediate medical evaluation and intervention, such as supplemental oxygen and further diagnostic testing. Therefore, she is best categorized as ESI level 2.","A 32-year-old female presents to the emergency department complaining of shortness of breath for several hours. No past medical history, +smoker. Vital signs: RR 32, HR 96, BP 126/80, SpO2 93% on room air, T 98.6˚F. No allergies, current medications include vitamins and birth control pills.","ESI level 2:  High  risk. This 32-year-old female with new-onset shortness of breath is on birth control pills. She is a smoker and is exhibiting signs and symptoms of respiratory distress (SpO2 and respiratory rate.)

,3,"The patient is a 60-year-old man with a painful, red, warm, swollen, and tender right foot and great toe. He has a history of type 2 diabetes and psoriasis. His vital signs are relatively stable: temperature is slightly elevated at 99.4˚F, respiratory rate is 18, heart rate is 82, blood pressure is 146/70, and oxygen saturation is 99%. The presentation suggests a possible infection, such as cellulitis, which is concerning given his diabetes, but there is no immediate threat to life or limb requiring immediate intervention. The patient will likely need diagnostic tests such as blood work or imaging and possibly treatment with antibiotics, indicating the use of more than one resource. However, he is not in severe pain or distress, and his vital signs are stable, so he does not meet criteria for ESI level 1 or 2. Given the need for multiple resources but stable condition, ESI level 3 is appropriate.","A 60-year-old man requests to see a doctor because his right foot hurts. On exam the great toe and foot skin is red, warm, swollen, and tender to touch. He denies injury. past medical history includes type 2 diabetes, and psoriasis.

,5,"The patient is a 52-year-old female presenting with symptoms suggestive of a urinary tract infection, such as dysuria and frequency. She denies more severe symptoms like abdominal pain or vaginal discharge, which suggests a straightforward UTI without complications. Her vital signs are within normal limits, indicating she is stable. She has no significant past medical history or allergies that would complicate her treatment. The patient's condition does not require immediate life-saving intervention (ESI 1), is not high risk (ESI 2), and does not require multiple resources (ESI 3). The evaluation and treatment of a UTI typically involve minimal resources, such as a urinalysis and possibly a prescription for antibiotics, which aligns with ESI 4 or 5. Given the straightforward nature of her symptoms and the minimal resources required, ESI 5 is appropriate.","A 52-year-old female requests to see a doctor for a possible urinary tract infection (UTI). She is complaining of dysuria and frequency. She denies abdominal pain or vaginal discharge. No allergies, takes vitamins, and has no significant past medical history.

,3,"The patient is a 34-year-old female, 3 months postpartum, presenting with symptoms suggestive of mastitis, including breast soreness, cracked nipples, and fever. Her vital signs show a fever of 102.8˚F, which indicates a systemic response to infection. However, her heart rate, respiratory rate, and blood pressure are within normal limits, and her pain level is moderate at 5/10. She does not require immediate life-saving intervention, ruling out ESI level 1. She is not in a high-risk situation that would require immediate attention, such as severe sepsis or hemodynamic instability, which rules out ESI level 2. The patient will likely require diagnostic tests (e.g., blood work, possibly imaging) and treatment (e.g., antibiotics, pain management), indicating the use of two or more resources, which aligns with ESI level 3. Her condition is not minor enough to be managed with minimal resources (ESI levels 4 or 5).","""My right breast is so sore, my nipples are cracked, and now I have a fever.

Her vital signs show a temperature of 101.6˚F, heart rate of 92, respiratory rate of 24, blood pressure of 148/86, and oxygen saturation of 97%. She is not in immediate life-threatening distress as her oxygen saturation is adequate and she is not in severe respiratory distress. Her respiratory rate is elevated, indicating some respiratory compromise, but not to the extent that immediate life-saving intervention is required. She will likely need some resources such as a nebulizer treatment or further evaluation for her fever and respiratory symptoms, but she is stable enough to not require immediate intervention. Therefore, she does not meet the criteria for ESI level 1 or 2. Given her stable vital signs and the need for some resources, she is best categorized as ESI level 3.","EMS arrives with a 45-year-old woman with asthma who has had  a  cold  for  week.

This history sounds more like pneumonia. Because the patient is not in acute respiratory distress, he or she doesn’t meet ESI level-2 criteria. This patient will require labs, a chest x ray, and perhaps IV antibiotics.",3
,4,"The patient is a 33-year-old female presenting with symptoms consistent with food poisoning, including vomiting and diarrhea. She reports abdominal cramping with a pain level of 5/10. Her vital signs are within normal limits: temperature is slightly below normal but not concerning, heart rate is slightly elevated but not critically high, respiratory rate is normal, and blood pressure is normal. She denies fever or chills, which suggests that there is no immediate life-threatening condition. The patient does not require immediate life-saving intervention (ESI 1), is not in a high-risk situation (ESI 2), and does not require multiple resources for evaluation and treatment (ESI 3). The patient may require some resources such as IV fluids or antiemetics, but these are not extensive (ESI 4). Given the symptoms and the need for minimal resources, the patient is best categorized as ESI 4.","“I think I have food poisoning,” reports an otherwise healthy 33-year-old female. “I have been vomiting all night, and now I have diarrhea.” The patient admits to abdominal cramping that she rates as 5/10. She denies fever or chills. Vital signs: T 96.8˚F, HR 96, RR 16, BP 116/74.","ESI level 3: Two or more resources.

,3,"The patient is a 37-year-old female with a history of migraines, presenting with a migraine that started early in the morning and is accompanied by vomiting. Her vital signs are: temperature 98˚F, respiratory rate 20, heart rate 102, blood pressure 118/62, and SpO2 98%. The pain level is reported as 6/10. The patient is not in immediate danger of losing life or limb, as her vital signs are relatively stable and there is no indication of a life-threatening condition. She is not in severe distress that would require immediate life-saving intervention (ESI 1). She is not at high risk of deterioration or requiring many resources (ESI 2). The patient will likely need more than one resource, such as IV fluids for dehydration from vomiting, antiemetics, and possibly imaging or medication for migraine management, which suggests an ESI level of 3. Her condition is not simple enough to be managed with minimal resources (ESI 4 or 5).","“My migraine started early this morning, and I can’t get it under control. I just keep vomiting.

,1,"The patient is a 26-year-old female who has been exposed to smoke inhalation from a burning building. She is experiencing respiratory distress, as evidenced by her hoarseness, sore throat, cough, and notably increased respiratory rate of 40 breaths per minute. Her heart rate is elevated at 114 beats per minute, which may be a response to respiratory distress or anxiety. She has a history of asthma, which increases her risk for severe respiratory complications in the context of smoke inhalation. The patient is working hard to breathe, indicating significant respiratory effort. Although her blood pressure is within normal limits, the combination of her symptoms and vital signs suggests she is at risk for respiratory failure. Immediate intervention is required to assess and manage her airway and breathing, possibly including oxygen therapy, bronchodilators, or advanced airway management. Therefore, she requires immediate life-saving intervention.","""The smoke was so bad; I just couldn’t breathe.” reports a 26-year-old female who entered her burning apartment building to try to rescue her cat. She is hoarse and complaining of a sore throat and a cough. You notice that she is working hard at breathing. History of asthma; uses inhalers when needed. No known drug allergies.

From the  history and presentation, this patient appears to have a significant airway injury and will require immediate intubation. Her respiratory rate is 40, and she is in respiratory distress.",1
,3,"The patient is a 27-year-old female who is 7 weeks pregnant and experiencing persistent vomiting, leading to concerns about dehydration. Her vital signs show a slightly elevated heart rate (HR 104), which could be indicative of dehydration. Her blood pressure is within normal limits, albeit on the lower side (BP 104/68), and her oxygen saturation is normal (SpO2 99%). She reports no pain (Pain 0/10), but her lips are dry and cracked, which supports the suspicion of dehydration. The patient does not require immediate life-saving intervention, so ESI level 1 is not appropriate. She is not in a high-risk situation that would require immediate attention, such as severe distress or altered mental status, so ESI level 2 is not appropriate. However, she does require more than one resource, such as IV fluids for rehydration and possibly antiemetics, which places her above ESI level 4 or 5. Therefore, the most appropriate ESI level is 3, as she is stable but requires multiple resources for treatment.","“I’m 7 weeks pregnant, and every time I try to eat something, I throw up,” reports a 27-year- old female. “My doctor sent me to the emergency department because he thinks I am getting dehydrated. T 97˚F, RR 18, HR 104, BP 104/68, SpO2 99%. Pain 0/10. Lips are dry and cracked.","ESI level 3: Two or more resources.

,3,"The patient is a 52-year-old female with an aching pain in her left leg after a prolonged period of sitting in a car. Her vital signs are within normal limits, and she denies any other complaints. The clinical presentation suggests a possible deep vein thrombosis (DVT) due to prolonged immobility, which is a risk factor for DVT, especially in an obese patient. However, she is hemodynamically stable and does not require immediate life-saving intervention. The situation does not indicate a high-risk condition that would require immediate intervention (ESI 1) or a high-risk situation that would require rapid intervention (ESI 2). The patient will likely need diagnostic testing, such as an ultrasound, to rule out DVT, which involves more than one resource. Therefore, the appropriate ESI level is 3.","“I have this aching pain in my left leg,” reports an obese 52-year-old female. “The whole ride home, it just ached and ached.” The patient  tells you that she has been sitting in a car for the last 2 days. “We drove my daughter to college, and I thought it was the heat getting to me.” She denies any other complaints.

,3,"The patient is an 87-year-old male who fell and hit his head. He is awake, alert, and oriented, which suggests that he is currently stable and not in immediate danger. His vital signs are within normal limits, indicating that there is no immediate physiological instability. However, he is on warfarin, an anticoagulant, which increases the risk of bleeding complications, especially after a head injury. This necessitates further evaluation to rule out any intracranial bleeding. While he does not require immediate life-saving intervention (ESI 1), his anticoagulation status and the potential for serious complications from the head injury elevate his priority. He will likely require a CT scan of the head and possibly other diagnostic tests, which means he will need multiple resources. Therefore, he does not fit the criteria for ESI 4 or 5, which are for patients requiring one or no resources, respectively. Given these considerations, the appropriate ESI level is 3, as he is stable but requires multiple resources for evaluation and management.","EMS arrives with an 87-year-old male who fell and hit his head. He is awake, alert, and oriented and remembers the fall. He has a past medical history of atrial fibrillation and is on multiple medications, including warfarin.

,5,"The patient is a 27-year-old male presenting with a request for a prescription refill for pain medication due to a back injury sustained at work. He denies any red flag symptoms such as numbness, tingling, or bladder or bowel issues, which suggests there is no immediate threat to life or limb. His vital signs are within normal limits, indicating he is stable. The primary concern is pain management, with the patient reporting a pain level of 10+/10. However, the absence of acute distress or life-threatening conditions, along with stable vital signs, suggests that this is not an emergency requiring immediate intervention. The patient's request for a prescription refill and the lack of need for multiple resources further supports a lower acuity level. Therefore, the situation is non-urgent, and minimal resources are needed.","“I just need another prescription for pain medication. I was here 10 days ago and ran out,” a 27-year-old male tells you. “I hurt my back at work, and it’s still bothering me.”  Denies numbness, tingling, or bladder or bowel issues.

She has a +2 pedal pulse, warm toes, and can wiggle them, indicating that there is no immediate threat to limb perfusion or function. Her vital signs are within normal limits, and she denies any past medical history, medications, or allergies. While the open fracture is a serious injury that requires prompt attention, it does not require immediate life-saving intervention, which would classify it as ESI level 1. The patient will need more than one resource, such as imaging, orthopedic consultation, and possibly surgery, which places her above ESI level 4 or 5. However, since her condition is stable and does not require immediate intervention, she is classified as ESI level 3.","EMS arrives with a 32-year-old female who fell off a stepladder while cleaning her first-floor gutters. She has an obvious open fracture of her right lower leg. She has +2 pedal pulse. Her toes are warm, and she is able to wiggle them.  Denies past medical history medications, or allergies.

,3,"The patient is a 27-year-old female with low abdominal pain and spotting, with a history of a previous ectopic pregnancy. Her vital signs are stable, and she does not report any severe symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, or urinary issues. The pain is moderate (6/10), and the spotting could indicate a potential complication related to her reproductive health, especially considering her last menstrual period was 7 weeks ago. The history of a previous ectopic pregnancy raises concern for a possible recurrent ectopic pregnancy, which can be life-threatening if not addressed. However, she is currently hemodynamically stable and does not require immediate life-saving intervention. She will likely need diagnostic resources such as an ultrasound and possibly laboratory tests to rule out an ectopic pregnancy or other complications. Therefore, she does not meet the criteria for ESI level 1 or 2, as she is stable and not in severe distress. Given the need for multiple resources to evaluate her condition, she is best categorized as ESI level 3.","A 27-year-old female wants to be checked by a doctor.

,3,"The patient presents with a swollen right leg and calf pain, which raises suspicion for deep vein thrombosis (DVT), especially given her risk factors such as obesity and a history of type 2 diabetes and hypertension. Her vital signs are mostly stable, with a slightly elevated respiratory rate, which could be due to pain or anxiety. She denies chest pain or shortness of breath, which reduces the immediate concern for a pulmonary embolism. Her oxygen saturation is normal at 98%. The pain level is moderate at 6/10. This presentation does not require immediate life-saving intervention (ESI 1) and is not high risk for immediate deterioration (ESI 2). The patient will likely require diagnostic testing, such as an ultrasound, to rule out DVT, which involves more than one resource. Therefore, the appropriate ESI level is 3.","“My right leg is swollen, and my calf hurts,” reports a 47-year-old morbidly obese female sitting in a motorized scooter.

,4,"The patient is a 25-year-old female presenting with dysuria, which is a common symptom of a urinary tract infection (UTI). She denies any systemic symptoms such as fever, chills, abdominal pain, or vaginal discharge, which suggests that the condition is localized and not severe. Her vital signs are within normal limits, indicating that she is hemodynamically stable. There is no indication of a life-threatening condition or the need for immediate life-saving intervention, ruling out ESI level 1. The absence of severe pain, distress, or abnormal vital signs suggests that she does not require high resource utilization or immediate attention, ruling out ESI levels 2 and 3. The patient will likely need a urinalysis and possibly a urine culture, which are minimal resources, consistent with ESI level 4. However, if the clinical setting allows for a quick urinalysis and prescription without significant resource use, ESI level 5 could be considered.

However, upon arrival, she is alert, oriented, with clear speech and equal hand grasps, indicating that the acute symptoms have resolved. She has a history of a previous stroke and is on aspirin, which increases her risk for another cerebrovascular event. While she is currently stable, the recent episode of neurological symptoms requires prompt evaluation to prevent a potential stroke. She does not require immediate life-saving intervention (ESI 1), but she does need to be seen promptly due to the risk of a serious condition. She will likely require multiple resources for further evaluation, such as imaging and possibly consultation with a neurologist. Therefore, the appropriate ESI level is 2, as she is at high risk for deterioration or a serious condition.","An 88-year-old female is brought to the ED by EMS. This morning, she had an episode of slurred speech and weakness of  her  left  arm that lasted about 45 minutes. She has a history  of a previous stroke, and she takes an aspirin every day.

Although she is experiencing bleeding during her first pregnancy, which is concerning, her vital signs are within normal limits, and she does not require immediate life-saving intervention. The situation is not life-threatening at this moment, but it does require further evaluation to rule out any complications related to the pregnancy. The patient will likely need some diagnostic tests, such as an ultrasound, to assess the status of the pregnancy. Therefore, she requires more than one resource but is not in a high-acuity category.","“It is like I have my period. I went to the bathroom, and I am bleeding. This is my first pregnancy, and I am scared. Do you think everything is OK?” asks a 26-year-old healthy female. Vital signs: BP 110/80, HR 72, RR 18, SpO2 99%, T 98.6˚F.

She appears pale and expresses a feeling of impending syncope, indicating possible hypovolemic shock due to significant blood loss. Her vital signs show hypotension (BP 86/40) and tachycardia (HR 132), which are consistent with shock. The respiratory rate is slightly elevated at 22, and SpO2 is normal at 98%. The combination of these symptoms and vital signs suggests that the patient is in a critical condition requiring immediate intervention to prevent further deterioration. According to the ESI, a patient who requires immediate life-saving intervention, such as fluid resuscitation or blood transfusion, is classified as ESI level 1.","“I suddenly started bleeding and passing clots the size of oranges,” reports a pale 34-year-old who is 10 days post partum. “I never did this with my other two pregnancies.

She is not on any medications and has no allergies. The patient is requesting a breathing treatment, which suggests she is familiar with her condition and its management. The respiratory rate is slightly elevated, but the oxygen saturation is normal, indicating that she is not in respiratory distress. She does not require immediate life-saving intervention, and her condition is stable. However, she will likely need a breathing treatment, which is a resource. Therefore, she does not meet the criteria for ESI level 1 or 2. Given that she will require at least one resource (a breathing treatment), she is best categorized as ESI level 4.","I have had a cold for a few days, and today I started wheezing. When this happens, I just need one of those breathing  treatments,” reports a 39-year-old female with a history of asthma.

Bystander CPR was initiated immediately, and the patient was defibrillated once by paramedics, resulting in the return of a perfusing rhythm. This indicates that the patient was in a critical state requiring immediate intervention. The initiation of the hypothermic cardiac arrest protocol and the administration of cold normal saline suggest ongoing critical care management. Given the need for immediate and continuous life-saving interventions, such as advanced cardiac life support and monitoring, the patient meets the criteria for ESI level 1, which is reserved for patients requiring immediate life-saving interventions.","A 58-year-old male collapsed while shoveling snow.

Although she is experiencing discomfort and symptoms that warrant evaluation, there are no immediate life-threatening conditions or signs of severe distress. The patient's vital signs are stable, and she does not require immediate life-saving intervention. However, given her recent surgery and current symptoms, she will likely require more than one resource for evaluation and management, such as imaging studies and laboratory tests. Therefore, she does not fit the criteria for ESI level 1 or 2. Her condition is more urgent than a level 4 or 5, which are for non-urgent cases requiring minimal resources. Thus, the appropriate ESI level is 3, as she is stable but requires multiple resources for further evaluation.","“My doctor told me to come to the ED.

These symptoms could indicate a potential cardiac issue, such as postpartum cardiomyopathy, which can occur after childbirth. The shortness of breath and swollen ankles suggest possible fluid overload or heart failure. While the patient is not in immediate distress or requiring life-saving intervention at this moment, her symptoms are concerning and warrant prompt evaluation to rule out serious conditions. Therefore, she requires more than one resource for evaluation, such as lab tests, imaging, and possibly a cardiology consult.","“I had a baby 5 weeks ago, and I am just exhausted.

His vital signs are within normal limits, so he does not meet ESI level-1 criteria.",2
,2,"The patient is an 82-year-old female with severe generalized abdominal pain and vomiting, indicating a potentially serious condition. Her vital signs show tachypnea (RR 28) and tachycardia (HR 102), which could suggest distress or a compensatory response to pain or another underlying issue. Although her blood pressure and oxygen saturation are within normal limits, the severity of her pain (10/10) and her age increase the concern for a serious underlying condition. She has a history of a heart attack, which adds to her risk profile. While she does not require immediate life-saving intervention (ESI 1), her presentation suggests a high likelihood of needing multiple resources for diagnosis and treatment, such as imaging, laboratory tests, and possibly surgical consultation. Therefore, she should be prioritized for rapid evaluation and treatment.","An 82-year-old resident of a local assisted living facility called 911 because of excruciating generalized abdominal pain and vomiting that started a few hours ago.

While her pain is severe, there is no indication of a need for immediate life-saving intervention, such as airway compromise, severe hemodynamic instability, or altered mental status, which would classify her as ESI level 1. The patient's condition does not suggest a high risk of deterioration or require immediate intervention, which would classify her as ESI level 2. The primary concern is pain management and possibly antiemetic treatment, which are not considered high resource interventions. Therefore, the patient is likely to require more than one resource (e.g., IV medication for pain and nausea), which aligns with ESI level 3. However, given the chronic nature of her condition and the absence of acute life-threatening symptoms, she does not require immediate evaluation.","“How long am I going to have to wait before I see a doctor?” asks a 27-year-old female with a migraine.

,2,"The patient is a 75-year-old male with a self-inflicted 6-centimeter laceration to the neck. Although the bleeding is currently controlled, the location and nature of the injury are concerning due to the potential for airway compromise or major vascular injury. The patient's vital signs are stable: BP 136/82, HR 74, RR 18, SpO2 98% on room air. However, the emotional distress and the context of the injury (recent loss of his wife) suggest a significant risk for further self-harm or psychological crisis. While the bleeding is controlled, the potential for rapid deterioration due to the location of the injury and the need for immediate psychiatric evaluation and intervention make this a high-priority case. The patient does not require immediate life-saving intervention at this moment, but the risk factors and the need for urgent intervention to prevent deterioration justify an ESI level of 2.","EMS arrives with a 75-year-old male with a self- inflicted 6-centimeter laceration to his neck.

,2,"The patient is a 72-year-old female who is disoriented and has altered mental status, which is a concerning symptom. She also has a fever (T 100.8˚F) and increased respiratory rate (RR 22), which could indicate an infection, possibly a urinary tract infection given the complaint of dysuria ('it hurts to pee'). The disorientation and altered mental status could suggest a more serious condition such as sepsis, especially in an elderly patient. While she is not in immediate need of life-saving intervention (ESI 1), her condition is serious and requires prompt evaluation and treatment. The altered mental status and potential for a serious underlying condition like sepsis elevate her to a higher acuity level. She is not stable enough to wait for a long period, and she will likely require multiple resources for diagnosis and treatment, such as lab tests, imaging, and IV antibiotics.","“My mother is just not acting herself,” reports the daughter of a 72-year-old female. She is sleeping more than usual and complains that it hurts to pee.” Vital signs: T 100.8˚F, HR 98, RR 22, BP 122/80. The patient responds to verbal stimuli but is disoriented to time and place.","ESI  level  2:  New  onset  confusion, lethargy, or disorientation.

She has no other complaints, and her vital signs are within normal range. She is currently on antibiotics for a UTI. The primary issue is the dislodged Foley catheter, which is not life-threatening and does not require immediate life-saving intervention. The patient is stable, and her condition does not require multiple resources for evaluation or treatment. The main intervention needed is the reinsertion of the Foley catheter, which is a single resource. Therefore, based on the ESI criteria, this situation is categorized as non-urgent and requires minimal resources.","EMS arrives in the ED with a 57-year-old female with multiple sclerosis. She is bedridden, and her family provides care in the home.  The family called 911 because her Foley catheter came out this morning. No other complaints.

,3,"The patient is a 73-year-old male who is oriented to person, place, and time, indicating that he is not in immediate danger of losing his airway, breathing, or circulation. His Glasgow Coma Scale score is 14, which suggests mild impairment but not severe enough to require immediate life-saving intervention. The patient has a 4-centimeter forehead laceration, which is a concern but not life-threatening. He is also intoxicated, as evidenced by drinking vodka, which may require monitoring and possibly some resources for wound care and observation. However, he does not meet the criteria for ESI level 1 or 2, as he is stable and does not require immediate intervention or have a high-risk situation. The laceration and intoxication may require some resources, such as suturing and monitoring, but not multiple resources. Therefore, the appropriate ESI level is 3, as he is stable but will likely need more than one resource for treatment.","“Why the hell don’t you just leave me alone?” yells a 73-year-old disheveled male who was brought to the ED by EMS.

The pain is described as 'unbelievable' and rated 20/10, suggesting severe pain. While this condition is not immediately life-threatening, it requires urgent evaluation and intervention to prevent long-term complications such as erectile dysfunction or urethral injury. The patient does not require immediate life-saving intervention (ESI 1), but the situation is urgent enough to warrant a higher priority than non-urgent cases. The patient will likely need imaging and possibly surgical intervention, indicating the use of multiple resources.","“This is so embarrassing,” reports a 42-year-old male. “We were having incredible sex, and I heard a crack.

She also reports having a fever since yesterday. The most critical finding is her SpO2 of 79%, which is significantly below normal and indicates severe hypoxemia. This low oxygen saturation level is life-threatening and requires immediate intervention to prevent further deterioration. According to the ESI guidelines, a patient with a life-threatening condition that requires immediate life-saving intervention, such as severe respiratory distress with hypoxemia, is classified as ESI level 1.","A 72-year-old female with obvious chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and increased work of breathing is wheeled into triage.

The patient is stable and does not require high resource intensity or multiple resources, which rules out ESI levels 2 and 3. The primary concern is the need for a tetanus booster, which is a single resource intervention. The patient is not in distress and does not require any complex workup or multiple resources, which aligns with ESI level 4. ESI level 5 is not appropriate as the patient does require a tetanus shot, which is a single resource.","“I think I need a tetanus shot,” a 29-year-old female tells you. “I stepped on a rusty nail this morning, and I know I haven’t had one for years.” No past medical history, No known drug allergies, no medications.",ESI level 5: No resources.

,3,"The patient is a 63-year-old male who is cachectic and has a history of a massive stroke, resulting in him being usually unresponsive. He is brought in because his feeding tube has fallen out. The key considerations for ESI triage are whether the patient requires immediate life-saving intervention, the number of resources needed, and the patient's vital signs. In this case, the patient does not require immediate life-saving intervention (ESI 1) as he is not in immediate distress or showing signs of critical instability. The issue is the dislodgement of the feeding tube, which is not life-threatening but does require medical attention to replace the tube. This situation typically requires one or more resources, such as a physician evaluation and the procedure to replace the feeding tube. The patient is not in severe pain or distress, and there is no indication of abnormal vital signs that would escalate the acuity level. Therefore, the appropriate ESI level is 3, as the patient needs multiple resources but is stable and not in immediate danger.",A 63-year-old cachectic male is brought in from the local nursing  home because his feeding tube fell out again.

,3,"The patient is a 64-year-old male who had a knee replacement 3 months ago and is now presenting with a red, swollen, and tender knee. These symptoms suggest a possible infection or inflammation of the knee joint, which could be serious given the recent surgery. However, the patient's vital signs are relatively stable: temperature is slightly elevated at 99°F, respiratory rate is 20, heart rate is 74, blood pressure is 164/74, and oxygen saturation is 97%. The pain level is moderate at 6/10. The patient does not require immediate life-saving intervention (ESI 1) and is not in a high-risk situation that would require immediate attention (ESI 2). The condition is not stable enough to be considered non-urgent (ESI 5), and it is likely that more than one resource will be needed to diagnose and treat the condition, such as imaging and laboratory tests, which places the patient at ESI 3.","“I had a knee replacement 3 months ago. Now look at it!” states a 64-year-old male. The knee is red, swollen and tender to touch. Vital signs: T 99°F, RR 20, HR 74, BP 164/74, SpO2 97%. Pain 6/10.","ESI level 3: Two or more resources. The patient is presenting with signs and symptoms of an infection. At a minimum, he will require labs, an x ray, an orthopedic consult, and IV antibiotics.",3
,3,"The patient is a 67-year-old female with a fever and cough for 3 days, producing thick green phlegm, which raises the suspicion of pneumonia. Her vital signs show a temperature of 102°F, respiratory rate of 28, heart rate of 86, blood pressure of 140/72, and SpO2 of 94%. She denies shortness of breath. The elevated respiratory rate and fever suggest a moderate level of distress, but she is not in immediate life-threatening condition. Her SpO2 is slightly low, indicating some respiratory compromise, but not severe enough to require immediate life-saving intervention. She will likely need diagnostic testing (e.g., chest X-ray, blood tests) and possibly treatment (e.g., antibiotics, fluids), which means she will require more than one resource. Therefore, she does not meet the criteria for ESI level 1 or 2. Given her age, symptoms, and the need for multiple resources, she is best categorized as ESI level 3.","EMS arrives with a 67-year-old female who lives alone. The patient called 911 because she was too sick to get herself to the doctor. The patient has had a fever and cough for 3 days. She reports coughing up thick green phlegm and is concerned that she has pneumonia. She denies shortness of breath.

Labs and a chest x ray are required, in addition to IV antibiotics. If vital signs are outside the accepted parameters, they may be considered high risk and meet ESI level-2 criteria.",3
,4,"The patient is presenting with anxiety due to a potential rabies exposure from a bat in her bedroom. There are no immediate life-threatening conditions or symptoms that require life-saving intervention, so ESI level 1 is not appropriate. The patient is stable with vital signs within normal limits, and there is no indication of a high-risk situation that would require immediate attention, ruling out ESI level 2. The primary concern is the potential need for rabies prophylaxis, which is a preventive measure rather than an urgent medical treatment. This situation does not require multiple resources, as the main intervention would be a consultation and possibly a rabies vaccine, which is a single resource. Therefore, the appropriate ESI level is 4, as the patient requires evaluation and possibly a single resource (rabies prophylaxis).","“I woke up this morning, and there was a bat flying around our bedroom. Scared me half to death, and now I am so worried about rabies,”  an anxious 48-year-old female tells you. “My husband opened the window, and the bat flew out.” Past medical history of ovarian cysts, no med or allergies, vital signs are within normal limits.","ESI level 4: One resource. It is unknown whether the patient was bitten by the bat because they were sleeping, so postexposure prophylaxis will be initiated. One resource—an intramuscular medication.",4
,1,"The patient is a 74-year-old male with severe mid-abdominal pain, which is significant given his wife's report that he is not a complainer. His vital signs are concerning: heart rate (HR) is 140, indicating tachycardia; respiratory rate (RR) is 28, indicating tachypnea; SpO2 is 94%, which is slightly low; and blood pressure (BP) is 72/56, indicating hypotension. These vital signs suggest hemodynamic instability and potential shock. The combination of severe pain, hypotension, and tachycardia suggests a life-threatening condition that requires immediate intervention. According to the ESI criteria, a patient with such vital signs and potential for rapid deterioration should be classified as ESI level 1, as they require immediate life-saving intervention.","The family of a 74-year-old male called 911 when he developed severe mid-abdominal pain. “My husband is not a complainer,” reports his wife. “The only medication he takes is for high blood pressure.” On arrival in the ED, the patient’s HR is 140, RR 28, SpO2 94%, BP 72/56.","ESI level 1: The patient is presenting with signs of shock, hypotension tachycardia, and tachypnea. He has a history of HTN and is presenting with signs and symptoms that could be suggestive of a dissecting aortic abdominal aneurysm. On arrival in the emergency department, he will require immediate lifesaving interventions such as immediate IV access, aggressive fluid resuscitation, and perhaps blood prior to surgery.",1
,5,"The patient is a 29-year-old with red and crusty eyes, likely indicating conjunctivitis, a common and non-urgent condition. She denies pain or visual disturbances, and her vital signs are normal, suggesting no immediate threat to life or limb. The condition is not life-threatening, does not require immediate intervention, and is unlikely to require multiple resources. Therefore, the patient does not meet criteria for ESI levels 1, 2, or 3. The condition is straightforward and likely requires minimal resources, such as a prescription for eye drops, aligning with ESI level 4 or 5. Given the non-urgent nature and minimal resource requirement, ESI level 5 is appropriate.","“I woke up this morning, and my eyes are all  red and crusty,” reports a 29-year-old kindergarten teacher. “I think I got it from the kids at school,” she tells you. She denies pain or other visual disturbances. Her vital signs are within normal limits.","ESI level 5: No resources.

,5,"The patient is a 19-year-old healthy male presenting with a skin rash in the groin area, which he suspects is jock itch. He has no abnormal vital signs, indicating he is stable. The condition described is not life-threatening and does not require immediate intervention. The patient is likely to need minimal resources, such as a physical examination and possibly a prescription for antifungal medication. There is no indication of severe pain, systemic symptoms, or any other complications that would necessitate a higher acuity level.","“I have this skin rash in my crotch. It looks like jock rot. Probably got it from not washing my gym clothes,” reports a 19-year-old healthy male. No abnormal vital signs.","ESI level 5: No resources. Following a physical exam, this young man will be discharged to home with a prescription and appropriate discharge instructions.",5
,5,"The patient is a 54-year-old diabetic male who is returning for a follow-up on a previously lanced boil. He reports feeling much better, indicating that there are no immediate life-threatening conditions. His vital signs are stable: temperature is normal at 98°F, respiratory rate is 16, heart rate is 64, blood pressure is 142/78, and oxygen saturation is 98%. The pain level is low at 2/10. The patient does not require immediate life-saving intervention, and there are no signs of high-risk conditions. The visit is primarily for a follow-up to ensure proper healing of the boil, which suggests that minimal resources will be needed. Therefore, the appropriate ESI level is 5, indicating a non-urgent situation with minimal resource needs.","“The doctor told me to come back this morning and have my boil checked. He lanced it yesterday and packed some stuff in it. He said he just want to make sure it is healing OK,” reports a 54-year-old diabetic male. The patient goes on to tell you that he feels so much better. T 98°F, RR 16, HR 64, BP 142/78, SpO2 98%. Pain 2/10.","ESI level 5: No resources. This patient was instructed to come back to the emergency department for a wound check. He will be examined and discharged to home. No resources are required. A point-of-care finger stick glucose is indicated, but this is not a resource.

,3,"The patient is a 43-year-old female with a history of asthma, presenting with wheezing, fever, and ineffective relief from a rescue inhaler. Her vital signs show a fever (T 101.4°F), tachypnea (RR 26), normal heart rate (HR 90), normal blood pressure (BP 138/70), and slightly reduced oxygen saturation (SpO2 95%). The primary concern is her respiratory status, given her history of asthma and current symptoms. She is not in immediate life-threatening distress (ESI 1), as her SpO2 is 95% and she is not in severe respiratory distress. However, she does require prompt evaluation and treatment due to her respiratory symptoms and history of asthma, which could potentially escalate. She will likely need more than one resource, such as nebulizer treatments, possibly steroids, and further monitoring. Therefore, she is best categorized as ESI level 3, which indicates the need for multiple resources but not immediate life-saving intervention.","“I have been wheezing for a few days, and  today I woke up with a fever. My rescue inhaler doesn’t seem to be helping,” reports a 43-year- old female with a past history of asthma.

,2,"The patient is a 56-year-old male with a sudden, transient loss of vision in one eye, lasting about 5 minutes. This symptom could indicate a transient ischemic attack (TIA) or other serious neurological or vascular event. The patient's history of hypertension and high cholesterol increases the risk for such events. While the symptom has resolved, the potential for a serious underlying condition requires prompt evaluation. The patient is stable and does not require immediate life-saving intervention, ruling out ESI level 1. However, the need for timely diagnostic evaluation and potential intervention to prevent a more serious event, such as a stroke, suggests a higher acuity level. The patient does not require multiple resources for immediate stabilization, but the urgency of the situation and the need for a thorough workup to rule out serious conditions aligns with ESI level 2.","“I was having breakfast with my wife, and all of a sudden I couldn’t see out of my right eye. It lasted about 5 minutes. I’m just scared because I’ve never had anything like this happen  before,” reports a 56-year-old male with a history of HTN and high cholesterol.","ESI level 2: High risk.

She reports significant pain at 8/10. There is no indication of a life-threatening condition or need for immediate life-saving intervention, ruling out ESI level 1. The patient is stable and does not require high resource intensity or multiple resources, which rules out ESI levels 2 and 3. The primary concern is pain management and possibly an X-ray to rule out a fracture, which suggests the need for one or two resources. This aligns with ESI level 4, as the patient will likely need an X-ray and pain medication.","“I was walking down the street and twisted my ankle as I stepped off the curb. I don’t think it’s broken, but it hurts so much,” report a 43-year- old female with a history of colitis. Vital signs:  T 98°F, HR 72, RR 18, BP 134/80, SpO2 100%.

,4,"The patient is a 26-year-old female with a history of colitis, presenting with increased stool frequency and cramping. Her vital signs are stable: temperature is 97°F, respiratory rate is 18, heart rate is 68, blood pressure is 112/76, and oxygen saturation is 100%. She reports a pain level of 6/10. There is no indication of a life-threatening condition or need for immediate life-saving intervention, so ESI level 1 is not appropriate. The patient is stable and does not appear to be in severe distress, ruling out ESI level 2. The patient will likely require more than one resource for evaluation and management, such as laboratory tests or imaging, but her condition is not urgent enough to be classified as ESI level 3. Given the stable vital signs and the nature of the symptoms, ESI level 4 is appropriate, as she will need one or more resources but is not in immediate danger.","“My colitis is acting up,” report a 26-year-old female. “It started with an increased number of stools, and now I am cramping a lot.

,3,"The patient is a 46-year-old female with a known history of sickle cell disease presenting with a pain crisis. Her pain is severe, rated at 8/10, and her current pain medication is ineffective. Despite the high pain level, her vital signs are stable and within normal limits, indicating that she is not in immediate life-threatening distress. According to the ESI guidelines, patients with severe pain due to a known condition like sickle cell crisis typically require more than one resource, such as pain management and possibly laboratory tests or IV fluids. However, they do not require immediate life-saving intervention, which would categorize them as ESI level 1. Given the need for multiple resources but stable vital signs, the appropriate ESI level is 3.","A 46-year-old female with a history of sickle cell disease presents to the emergency department because of a crisis. She has pain in her lower legs that began 8 hours ago, and the pain medication she is taking is not working. Currently, she rates her pain as 8/10. She has no other medical problems, and her current medications include folate and vicodin. Vital signs are all within normal limits.","ESI level 2: High risk.

,3,"The patient is a 54-year-old male on blood thinners with a history of clots in his legs, now presenting with pain and swelling in the lower leg. This presentation is concerning for a possible deep vein thrombosis (DVT), especially given his history and current symptoms. However, his vital signs are within normal limits, and he denies any other complaints, indicating that he is currently stable. The situation does not require immediate life-saving intervention (ESI 1), and he is not in severe distress or at high risk of deterioration (ESI 2). The patient will likely require diagnostic testing, such as an ultrasound, to confirm the presence of a DVT, which involves more than one resource. Therefore, the appropriate ESI level is 3.","“I take a blood thinner because I have had clots in my legs,” reports a 54-year-old black male. “They told me that medicine would prevent them, but today I have pain and swelling in my lower leg. It started out just being sore, but now I can hardly walk on it.” Denies any other complaints. Vital signs within normal limits.",ESI level 3: Two or more resources.

The need for a PEG tube replacement is a planned procedure and does not require immediate life-saving intervention. The patient's condition is stable, and she is not in distress. The procedure is straightforward and does not require multiple resources. Therefore, the patient does not meet the criteria for ESI levels 1, 2, or 3. Given that the procedure is non-urgent and requires minimal resources, the appropriate ESI level is 4.","A 65-year-old female is brought in by ambulance from the local nursing home for replacement of her PEG tube.

Her vital signs are within normal limits, indicating no immediate physiological distress. However, due to the potential risk of self-harm and her psychiatric history, she requires urgent mental health evaluation and intervention. This situation does not require immediate life-saving intervention (ESI 1), but it is more urgent than a non-urgent visit (ESI 5). The need for a mental health evaluation and the potential for self-harm elevate her acuity level to ESI 2, as she is a high-risk situation that requires timely intervention.","26-year-old female presents to the ED because she can’t get an appointment  with  her therapist.
