Output your response strictly in JSON format with the following keys:\n""Reasoning"": <the step by step rationale>,\n""Acuity"": <the assigned acuity level as an integer between 1 and 5>,\n', 'user': ""### Instructions\nYour task is to determine the patient's ESI acuity based on the patient's clinical presentation, where ESI 1 indicates the highest priority (requiring immediate, life-saving intervention), and ESI 5 indicates the lowest priority (non-urgent, minimal resources needed). Let's first understand the problem and solve the problem step by step.\n\n** Step 1: Assess Immediate Risk for ESI Level 1 **\n\n- Is the patient dying or at immediate risk of death?\n- Does the patient require an immediate life-saving intervention?\n\n** Step 2: Evaluate Key Clinical Signs for ESI Level 2 **\n\nAssess High-Risk Situations: Identify patients with potentially life-threatening conditions who do not require immediate life-saving interventions but should not wait. Use the rule of thumb: “Would I use my last open bed for this patient?” Key indicators include:\n- Severe chest pain, suspected acute coronary syndrome (ACS)\n- Respiratory distress (e.g., severe asthma, pleural effusion)\n- Neurological deficits (e.g., stroke symptoms, meningitis suspicion)\n- Uncontrolled bleeding or significant trauma\n\nEvaluate Mental Status Changes: Classify patients with new onset confusion, lethargy, or disorientation as ESI Level 2. This includes:\n- Suspected stroke (sudden motor/speech deficits)\n- Altered mental status from metabolic, toxic, or neurological causes\n- Pediatric patients with signs of sepsis or dehydration\n\nPrioritize Severe Pain or Distress: Patients reporting severe pain (≥7/10) or severe psychological distress may qualify for Level 2 if their condition necessitates immediate intervention. Examples:\n- Sickle cell crisis or acute oncologic pain\n- Severe abdominal pain in elderly patients\n- Trauma with high pain burden requiring urgent evaluation\n\n** Step 3: Differentiate between ESI 3, 4 and 5 **\n- Resource prediction is an integral part of the ESI for patients identified as ESI level 3 (many resources), 4 (one resource), or 5 (no resources).\n- Resources include: Labs (blood, urine), ECG, X-rays, CT-MRI-ultrasound, angiography, IV fluids (hydration) , IV, IM or nebulized medications, Specialty consultation, Simple procedure (lac repair, Foley cath), Complex procedure (conscious sedation) \n- Check Danger Zone Vitals: If the patient has very high heart rate, breathing rate, or oxygen saturation below 92%, consider upgrading to ESI Level 2. Use these thresholds:\n    - HR: >180 (infants), >160 (toddlers), >140 (children), >100 (older children/adults)\n    - RR: >50 (infants), >40 (toddlers), >30 (children), >20 (older children/adults)\n    - SaO₂: <92%\n\n** Step 4: If it's not clear by now, determine the appropriate ESI acuity level to the best of your ability. **\n     \n\n### Patient's Clinical Presentation\n“I ran out of my blood pressure medicine, and my doctor is on vacation. Can someone here write me a prescription?” requests a 56-year-old male with a history of HTN.

Step 2: The patient does not present with high-risk situations such as severe chest pain, respiratory distress, neurological deficits, uncontrolled bleeding, or significant trauma. There are no mental status changes or severe pain/distress reported. Step 3: The patient's vital signs are within normal limits and do not fall into the danger zone. The patient is requesting a prescription refill, which does not require multiple resources. Step 4: The patient's condition is non-urgent, and they do not require any immediate medical intervention or resources beyond a possible prescription. Therefore, the appropriate ESI acuity level is 5.","“I ran out of my blood pressure medicine, and my doctor is on vacation. Can someone here write me a prescription?” requests a 56-year-old male with a history of HTN. Vital signs: BP 128/84, HR 76, RR 16, T 97˚F.","ESI level  5: No resources. The patient needs  a prescription refill and has no other medical complaints. His blood pressure is controlled with his current medication. If at triage his blood pressure was 188/124 and he complained of a headache,, then he would meet the criteria for a high-risk situation and be assigned to ESI level 2. If this patient’s BP was elevated and the patient had no complaints, he or she would remain an ESI level 5. The blood pressure would be repeated and would most likely not be  treated in the ED or treated with PO medications.",5
,3,"Step 1: The patient is not dying or at immediate risk of death, and does not require immediate life-saving intervention, so ESI Level 1 is not applicable. Step 2: The patient does not present with high-risk situations such as severe chest pain, respiratory distress, neurological deficits, or uncontrolled bleeding. There is no indication of altered mental status or severe pain/distress that would necessitate ESI Level 2. Step 3: The patient has a wrist injury and a laceration, which will likely require an X-ray and possibly a simple procedure for the laceration. This suggests the need for multiple resources, indicating ESI Level 3. The patient's vital signs are not provided, but there is no indication of danger zone vitals that would upgrade the acuity level. Step 4: Based on the need for multiple resources and the absence of high-risk factors, the patient is best categorized as ESI Level 3.","A 41-year-old male involved in a bicycle accident walks into the emergency department with his right arm in a sling. He tells you that he fell off his bike and landed on his right arm. His is complaining of pain in the wrist area and has a 2-centimeter laceration on his left elbow. “My helmet saved me,” he tells you.","ESI level 3: Two or more resources. At a minimum, this patient will require an x ray of his right arm and suturing of his left elbow laceration.",3
,2,"Step 1: The patient is not dying or at immediate risk of death, as she is conscious and her vital signs are relatively stable, though she is experiencing respiratory distress. Step 2: The patient is experiencing shortness of breath with a respiratory rate of 32 and an oxygen saturation of 93%, which indicates respiratory distress. Although her SpO2 is slightly above the danger zone threshold of 92%, her elevated respiratory rate suggests a high-risk situation. Step 3: The patient's condition suggests she may require multiple resources, such as oxygen therapy, chest X-ray, and possibly nebulized medications, which would typically place her in ESI Level 3. However, given her respiratory distress and the potential for rapid deterioration, she should be prioritized as ESI Level 2. Step 4: Based on the assessment, the patient is experiencing significant respiratory distress and should be assigned ESI Level 2 to ensure prompt evaluation and treatment.","A 32-year-old female presents to the emergency department complaining of shortness of breath for several hours.

,3,"Step 1: The patient is not dying or at immediate risk of death and does not require immediate life-saving intervention, so ESI Level 1 is not applicable. Step 2: The patient does not present with high-risk situations such as severe chest pain, respiratory distress, neurological deficits, or uncontrolled bleeding. There are no mental status changes or severe pain/distress that would qualify for ESI Level 2. Step 3: The patient's condition involves a red, warm, swollen, and tender foot, likely indicating an infection such as cellulitis. This will likely require multiple resources such as labs, imaging, and possibly IV antibiotics, which aligns with ESI Level 3. The patient's vital signs are stable and do not meet the danger zone criteria for upgrading to ESI Level 2. Step 4: Based on the need for multiple resources and stable vital signs, the appropriate ESI acuity level is 3.","A 60-year-old man requests to see a doctor because his right foot hurts.

Step 2: The patient does not present with high-risk situations such as severe chest pain, respiratory distress, neurological deficits, uncontrolled bleeding, or significant trauma. There are no mental status changes or severe pain/distress reported. Therefore, ESI Level 2 is not applicable. Step 3: The patient is likely to require one resource, such as a urinalysis, to confirm the diagnosis of a UTI. There are no danger zone vitals, as her HR, RR, and SaO₂ are within normal limits. Step 4: The patient is presenting with symptoms of a UTI, which typically requires minimal resources for diagnosis and treatment.

,3,"Step 1: The patient is not at immediate risk of death and does not require life-saving intervention, so ESI Level 1 is not applicable. Step 2: The patient has a fever and breast soreness, which could indicate mastitis, a common postpartum condition. However, she is not in severe distress, and her pain level is moderate (5/10). Her vital signs are stable, with a heart rate of 90, respiratory rate of 18, and blood pressure of 108/60. There are no signs of respiratory distress, neurological deficits, or severe pain that would necessitate ESI Level 2. Step 3: The patient will likely require some resources, such as lab tests to confirm infection and possibly imaging to rule out abscess, as well as antibiotics (non-penicillin due to allergy). This suggests ESI Level 3, as she will need multiple resources but is stable. Her vital signs do not fall into the danger zone, so there is no need to upgrade to ESI Level 2.

Step 4: The patient's presentation of sudden severe headache, pregnancy, and altered mental status confirms the need for immediate evaluation and intervention, solidifying the assignment of ESI Level 2.","26-year-old female is transported by EMS to the ED because she experienced the sudden onset of a severe headache that began after she moved her bowels. She is 28 weeks pregnant. Her husband tells you that she is healthy, takes only prenatal vitamins, and has no allergies.  On arrival in the ED, the patient is moaning and does not respond to voice. Emergency medical technicians (EMTs) tell you that she vomited about 5 minutes ago.","ESI  level  1:  Requires  immediate lifesaving intervention. From the history, it sounds like this patient has suffered some type of head bleed. She is currently unresponsive to voice and could be showing signs of increased intracranial pressure. She may not be able to protect her own airway and may need to be emergently intubated",1
,2,"Step 1: The patient is not at immediate risk of death and does not require immediate life-saving intervention, so ESI Level 1 is not appropriate. Step 2: The patient reports symptoms suggestive of a neurological deficit, specifically facial drooping and inability to close one eye, which are potential signs of a stroke. Although her vital signs are normal, the sudden onset of these symptoms and the potential for a serious condition like a stroke make her a high-risk situation. Therefore, she should be classified as ESI Level 2. Step 3: Since she is already classified as ESI Level 2, further differentiation between ESI 3, 4, and 5 is not necessary.","“I think I’m having a stroke,” reports an  anxious 40-year-old female. “I looked in the mirror this morning, and the corner of my mouth is drooping and I can’t close my left eye. You have to help me, please.” No past medical history, no meds. Vital signs all within normal limits.",ESI level 2: High risk. Facial droop is one of the classic signs of a stroke. This patient needs to be evaluated by the stroke team and have a head CT within minutes of arrival in the ED. Many nurses want to make all stroke alerts an ESI level 1. This patient does not meet level 1 criteria as she does not require immediate lifesaving. interventions. The triage nurse needs to facilitate moving this patient into the treatment area and initiate the stroke alert process,2
,2,"Step 1: The patient is not dying or at immediate risk of death, as she is alert and oriented with clear speech and equal hand grasps. No immediate life-saving intervention is required. Step 2: The patient had an episode of slurred speech and weakness in her left arm, which are symptoms suggestive of a transient ischemic attack (TIA) or stroke. Given her history of a previous stroke, she is at high risk for another stroke. Although her symptoms have resolved, the recent episode and her medical history place her in a high-risk category. Therefore, she should not wait and should be prioritized for evaluation and treatment. Step 3: While she is currently stable, the potential for a serious condition (stroke) and the need for further evaluation (likely requiring imaging and possibly other resources) support a higher acuity level. Step 4: Based on the high-risk nature of her presentation and the need for prompt evaluation, she is best categorized as ESI Level 2.","An 88-year-old female is brought to the ED by EMS. This morning, she had an episode of slurred speech and weakness of  her  left  arm that lasted about 45 minutes. She has a history  of a previous stroke, and she takes an aspirin every day. She is alert and oriented with clear speech and equal hand grasps.","ESI level 2: High-risk situation. The patient’s history indicates that she may have had a transient ischemic attack this morning. The patient is high risk, and it would not be safe for her to sit in the waiting room for an extended period of time.",2
,3,"Step 1: The patient is not at immediate risk of death and does not require life-saving intervention, so ESI Level 1 is not applicable. Step 2: The patient is not in a high-risk situation, as her vital signs are stable, and she does not exhibit severe pain or distress. There are no signs of severe bleeding, respiratory distress, or neurological deficits. Therefore, ESI Level 2 is not applicable. Step 3: The patient's condition does not require many resources. She may need an ultrasound or consultation, but her stable vital signs and low pain level suggest that she does not need immediate intervention. Her condition is not life-threatening, and she is not in severe distress. Step 4: The patient is likely to require one or two resources, such as an ultrasound and possibly a consultation, but her stable condition and low pain level suggest that she does not need immediate intervention. Therefore, ESI Level 3 is appropriate.","“It is like I have my period. I went to the bathroom, and I am bleeding. This is my first pregnancy, and I am scared. Do you think everything is OK?” asks a 26-year-old healthy female. Vital signs: BP 110/80, HR 72, RR 18, SpO2 99%, T 98.6˚F. She describes the pain as crampy, but rates it as “1” out of 10.","ESI level 3: Two or more  resources.  Based on her history, this patient will require two or more resources – labs, an ultrasound. On the differential diagnosis list is a spontaneous abortion. Currently, she is hemodynamically stable and has minimal cramping or pain.",3
,2,"Step 1: The patient is not immediately dying but is at significant risk due to postpartum hemorrhage, indicated by severe bleeding and passing large clots. Her vital signs show hypotension (BP 86/40) and tachycardia (HR 132), suggesting significant blood loss and potential for shock. Step 2: The patient is high-risk due to the postpartum status and significant bleeding, which could lead to life-threatening complications if not addressed promptly. Her request to lie down before passing out indicates potential for syncope due to hypovolemia. Step 3: Although her SpO2 is 98%, her other vital signs are concerning, and she will likely require multiple resources, including IV fluids, blood transfusion, and possibly surgical intervention. Step 4: Given the high-risk nature of her condition and the need for immediate intervention to prevent deterioration, she is best classified as ESI Level 2.","“I suddenly started bleeding and passing clots the size of oranges,” reports a pale 34-year-old who is 10 days post partum. “I never did this with my other two pregnancies.

The patient needs immediate IV access and aggressive fluid resuscitation.",1
,4,"Step 1: The patient is not dying or at immediate risk of death and does not require immediate life-saving intervention, so ESI Level 1 is not applicable. Step 2: The patient is not in a high-risk situation, as she is not experiencing severe respiratory distress, severe pain, or altered mental status. Her vital signs are stable, and her SpO2 is 99%, indicating adequate oxygenation. Therefore, ESI Level 2 is not applicable. Step 3: The patient likely requires a breathing treatment, which is considered a resource. Her condition is stable, and she does not require multiple resources. Therefore, ESI Level 3 is not applicable. Step 4: The patient requires one resource (breathing treatment), which aligns with ESI Level 4. Her vital signs are not in the danger zone, confirming that ESI Level 4 is appropriate.","I have had a cold for a few days, and today I started wheezing. When this happens, I just need one of those breathing  treatments,” reports a 39-year-old female with a history of asthma. T 98˚F, RR 22, HR 88, BP 130/80, SpO2 99%, No meds, no allergies.",ESI level 4: One resource. This patient will need a hand-held nebulizer treatment for her wheezing. No labs or x ray should be necessary because the patient does not have a fever.,4
,1,"Step 1: The patient is not currently dying but was in a life-threatening situation (cardiac arrest) and required immediate life-saving intervention (defibrillation and CPR). Step 2: The patient is at high risk due to recent cardiac arrest and hypothermia, requiring immediate and continuous monitoring and intervention. Step 3: The patient will require multiple resources, including continuous cardiac monitoring, possible further defibrillation, and management of hypothermia. Step 4: Given the recent cardiac arrest and ongoing critical care needs, the patient is best classified as ESI Level 1 due to the need for immediate life-saving interventions and continuous critical care.","A 58-year-old male collapsed while shoveling snow. Bystander CPR was started immediately; he was defibrillated once by the paramedics with the return of a perfusing rhythm. The hypothermic cardiac arrest protocol was initiated prehospital, and he presents with cold normal saline infusing.","ESI  level  1:  Requires   immediate lifesaving intervention. Studies have shown that lowering brain temperature post cardiac arrest decreases ischemic damage. This patient requires immediate lifesaving interventions to airway, breathing, circulation, and neurologic outcome. Even though the patient converted to a stable rhythm, the nurse should anticipate that additional lifesaving interventions might be necessary.",1
,3,"Step 1: The patient is not at immediate risk of death and does not require immediate life-saving intervention, so ESI Level 1 is not applicable. Step 2: The patient does not present with high-risk situations such as severe chest pain, respiratory distress, neurological deficits, or uncontrolled bleeding. Her pain is rated 6/10, which is not severe enough to qualify for ESI Level 2. Step 3: The patient's condition may require multiple resources for evaluation and management, such as imaging studies or lab tests to assess for post-surgical complications like obstruction or infection. Her vital signs are stable and do not fall into the danger zone. Therefore, ESI Level 3 is appropriate as she will likely need multiple resources but is not in immediate danger.","“My doctor told me to come to the ED. I had a gastric bypass 3 weeks ago and have been doing fine, but today I started vomiting and having this belly pain.” The patient, an obese 33-year- old female, rates her pain as 6/10.

,2,"Step 1: The patient is not at immediate risk of death and does not require immediate life-saving intervention, so ESI Level 1 is not applicable. Step 2: The patient presents with shortness of breath and swollen ankles, which could indicate a high-risk situation such as heart failure or pulmonary embolism, especially postpartum. These symptoms warrant further investigation and should not wait, suggesting ESI Level 2. Step 3: The patient's symptoms suggest a need for multiple resources, such as labs, imaging, and possibly specialty consultation, which aligns with ESI Level 3. However, the potential high-risk nature of her symptoms (shortness of breath and edema postpartum) elevates her to ESI Level 2. Step 4: Given the potential for a serious underlying condition, the patient should be prioritized as ESI Level 2.","“I had a baby 5 weeks ago, and I am just exhausted.

Step 2: The patient has a significant cardiac history and received a shock from an internal defibrillator, which is a high-risk situation. Although the patient is stable now, the defibrillator shock indicates a potential life-threatening arrhythmia. This situation warrants prioritization to prevent further cardiac events. Step 3: The patient's vital signs are stable and do not fall into the danger zone. However, the high-risk nature of the cardiac event and the potential for serious underlying issues justify an ESI Level 2 classification. Step 4: Given the high-risk cardiac history and recent defibrillator shock, the patient should be classified as ESI Level 2 to ensure prompt evaluation and management.","“My wife called 911 because my internal defibrillator gave me a shock this morning when I was eating breakfast.

However, there are no signs of severe distress, respiratory issues, or altered mental status. The pain is reported as 6/10, which is moderate but not severe enough to qualify for ESI Level 2. Step 3: The patient's vital signs are mostly within normal limits, except for a fever. The heart rate is likely a typo at 990, assuming it should be 99, which is not in the danger zone. The patient will likely require multiple resources such as labs, possible imaging, and IV antibiotics, which aligns with ESI Level 3.

Although the bleeding is controlled, the nature of the injury and the emotional state suggest a need for urgent psychiatric evaluation and intervention. The patient's stable vital signs do not indicate immediate physiological distress, but the psychological component and the nature of the injury warrant prioritization. Step 3: The patient does not require multiple resources for immediate stabilization, but the need for psychiatric evaluation and potential for further intervention (e.g., suturing, psychiatric consultation) suggests more than minimal resources.

,1,"Step 1: Assess Immediate Risk for ESI Level 1. The patient is not in cardiac arrest but is at immediate risk of death due to suspected acute coronary syndrome (ACS) with hypotension (BP 72/53) and tachycardia (HR 106). The patient requires immediate life-saving interventions such as stabilization of blood pressure and potential reperfusion therapy. Step 2: Evaluate Key Clinical Signs for ESI Level 2. The patient presents with severe chest pain and signs of shock (cool, clammy skin, hypotension), indicating a high-risk situation. However, the need for immediate life-saving intervention places the patient in ESI Level 1. Step 3: Differentiate between ESI 3, 4, and 5. Not applicable as the patient requires immediate intervention. Step 4: Determine the appropriate ESI acuity level. The patient's condition, including hypotension and signs of shock, necessitates immediate intervention, confirming ESI Level 1.","The overhead page announces the arrival of the Code STEMI.

His skin is cool and clammy.","ESI  level  1:   Requires   immediate lifesaving intervention. This patient is experiencing another cardiac event that requires immediate treatment. His vital signs and skin perfusion are suggestive of cardiogenic shock, and the patient may require fluid resuscitation or vasopressors to treat hypotension.",1
,3,"Step 1: The patient is not at immediate risk of death and does not require life-saving intervention, so ESI Level 1 is not applicable. Step 2: The patient does not present with high-risk symptoms such as severe chest pain, respiratory distress, or neurological deficits. The pain level is 6/10, which is not severe enough to qualify for ESI Level 2. Step 3: The patient's condition involves a red, swollen, and tender knee, likely requiring multiple resources such as labs, imaging, and possibly IV antibiotics or consultation. The vital signs are stable and do not fall into the danger zone. Therefore, the patient is likely to require multiple resources, indicating ESI Level 3. Step 4: Based on the assessment, the appropriate ESI acuity level is 3.","“I had a knee replacement 3 months ago. Now look at it!” states a 64-year-old male. The knee is red, swollen and tender to touch. Vital signs: T 99°F, RR 20, HR 74, BP 164/74, SpO2 97%. Pain 6/10.","ESI level 3: Two or more resources.

Although she has a fever and cough, she denies shortness of breath, and her SpO2 is 94%, which is above the danger zone threshold. Her mental status is not altered, and she does not report severe pain or distress. Therefore, ESI Level 2 is not appropriate. Step 3: The patient will likely require multiple resources, such as labs (to check for infection), a chest X-ray (to evaluate for pneumonia), and possibly IV antibiotics or fluids. Her respiratory rate is elevated at 28, but her other vital signs are stable, and her SpO2 is above 92%. Given the need for multiple resources and the absence of danger zone vitals, ESI Level 3 is appropriate.

Step 2: The patient does not present with high-risk symptoms such as severe chest pain, respiratory distress, neurological deficits, uncontrolled bleeding, or severe pain/distress. Her main concern is anxiety about potential rabies exposure, which does not qualify for ESI Level 2. Step 3: The patient's vital signs are within normal limits, and there are no danger zone vitals. The primary concern is rabies exposure, which may require a consultation or rabies prophylaxis, but this is not an immediate high-risk situation. The patient may require one resource (consultation or prophylaxis), which aligns with ESI Level 4. Step 4: Based on the information, the patient is not in immediate danger, and her condition is not urgent, so ESI Level 4 is appropriate.","“I woke up this morning, and there was a bat flying around our bedroom. Scared me half to death, and now I am so worried about rabies,”  an anxious 48-year-old female tells you. “My husband opened the window, and the bat flew out.” Past medical history of ovarian cysts, no med or allergies, vital signs are within normal limits.","ESI level 4: One resource.

The heart rate is 140, and respiratory rate is 28, both of which are elevated, and the SpO2 is slightly low at 94%. These signs suggest a potentially life-threatening condition that requires urgent evaluation and intervention. Step 3: The patient's condition suggests the need for multiple resources, including imaging and possibly surgical consultation, but the danger zone vitals (HR 140, RR 28) and hypotension suggest an upgrade to ESI Level 2.

Step 2: The patient does not present with high-risk situations such as severe chest pain, respiratory distress, neurological deficits, uncontrolled bleeding, or severe pain/distress. There are no mental status changes or severe pain reported. Therefore, ESI Level 2 is not applicable. Step 3: The patient's condition suggests conjunctivitis, which is not life-threatening and does not require multiple resources. The patient denies pain or visual disturbances, and vital signs are normal. This suggests minimal resources are needed, likely just a prescription for eye drops. Step 4: The condition is non-urgent, and the patient likely requires no resources or just a simple prescription, fitting ESI Level 5.","“I woke up this morning, and my eyes are all  red and crusty,” reports a 29-year-old kindergarten teacher. “I think I got it from the kids at school,” she tells you.

Step 2: The patient experienced sudden vision loss in one eye, which is a high-risk situation potentially indicative of a transient ischemic attack (TIA) or stroke. This condition is potentially life-threatening and requires prompt evaluation. The patient's age and history of hypertension and high cholesterol increase the risk of cerebrovascular events. Therefore, the patient should not wait and should be prioritized for immediate evaluation, fitting the criteria for ESI Level 2. Step 3: Resource prediction and danger zone vitals are not necessary to evaluate as the patient already qualifies for ESI Level 2 based on the high-risk situation.","“I was having breakfast with my wife, and all of a sudden I couldn’t see out of my right eye.
