He needs immediate IV access, the administration of medications, and external pacing pads in place.",1
,2,"Step 1: Assess the Patient's Risk & Resource Needs - The patient is experiencing difficulty breathing due to fluid buildup in the lungs, which is a significant concern. Her respiratory rate is elevated at 34, indicating respiratory distress, although her SpO2 is 95%, which is borderline normal. The patient has metastatic breast cancer, which complicates her condition. Step 2: Analyze and Compare with Other Patient Cases - Comparing with the example of the 19-year-old male with shortness of breath and SpO2 of 92% who was assigned ESI 2, this patient also presents with respiratory distress, though her SpO2 is slightly better. However, her underlying condition of metastatic cancer and the need for a procedure to drain fluid suggests a higher acuity. Step 3: Determine the ESI acuity level for this patient based on the examples and your assessment of the patient's clinical presentation - Given the respiratory distress and the need for a potentially resource-intensive procedure (fluid drainage), the patient should be assigned an ESI level of 2.","“My sister has metastatic breast cancer, and her doctor suggested that I bring her in today to have more fluid drained off her lungs.” The fluid buildup is making it harder for her to breathe. The patient is a cachectic 42-year-old female on multiple medications. Vital signs: T 98.6˚F, RR 34, SpO2 95%, HR 92, BP 114/80.",ESI level 2: High risk. Breast cancer can metastasize to the lungs and can cause a pleural effusion. The collection of fluid in the pleural space leads to increasing respiratory distress as evidenced by the increased respiratory rate and work of breathing.,2
,3,"The patient is a 58-year-old male with left lower-quadrant abdominal pain for 3 days. He denies nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea, and there is no change in appetite. His past medical history includes hypertension. Vital signs are relatively stable: temperature is slightly elevated at 100˚F, respiratory rate is 18, heart rate is 80, blood pressure is 140/72, and SpO2 is 98%. Pain is reported as 5/10. The patient's condition does not appear to be life-threatening or require immediate intervention, as there are no signs of severe distress or instability. The patient will likely require diagnostic testing, such as imaging or lab work, to determine the cause of the abdominal pain, which suggests the need for more than one resource. Comparing this case to the examples, it is similar to cases where patients required diagnostic evaluation but were not in immediate danger, such as the 7-year-old with a stomach ache (Acuity Level 3) or the patient with a fractured wrist and swelling (Acuity Level 2). However, given the stable vital signs and the absence of severe symptoms, this case aligns more closely with a Level 3 acuity, where multiple resources are needed but the situation is not urgent.","A 58-year-old male presents to the emergency department complaining of left lower-quadrant abdominal pain for 3 days.

The vital signs show a mild fever (100.8˚F), normal respiratory rate (20), heart rate (92), blood pressure (118/80), and oxygen saturation (99%). The pain is moderate at 5/10. The clinical presentation suggests a possible post-abortion complication, such as an infection, which requires prompt evaluation and treatment. Step 2: Analyze and Compare with Other Patient Cases - Comparing with other cases, the patient with a fever and potential infection post-procedure is similar to cases where patients had conditions requiring more than one resource for evaluation and treatment, such as imaging and antibiotics. Step 3: Determine the ESI acuity level for this patient based on the examples and your assessment of the patient's clinical presentation - Given the potential for a serious infection and the need for multiple resources, such as laboratory tests, imaging, and possibly antibiotics, the patient is best categorized as ESI level 3.","A-25-year-old  female  presented  to  the emergency department  because  of  moderate lower abdominal pain with a  fever  and  chills.

She reports a decrease in fluid intake and inability to take supplements due to vomiting. Her vital signs are stable, with normal temperature, respiratory rate, heart rate, blood pressure, and oxygen saturation. The pain is moderate at 4/10. The main concern is the potential for dehydration and nutritional deficiencies due to decreased intake. Step 2: Analyze and Compare with Other Patient Cases - Comparing with other cases, this patient does not require immediate life-saving intervention (ESI 1) or high-risk interventions (ESI 2). The symptoms are concerning but not immediately life-threatening. The patient will likely require some diagnostic tests and possibly IV fluids, which aligns with ESI 3. Step 3: Determine the ESI acuity level for this patient based on the examples and your assessment of the patient's clinical presentation - Given the stable vital signs and the need for diagnostic evaluation and potential treatment for dehydration, the appropriate ESI level is 3.","The patient states that she is 6 weeks post laparoscopic gastric bypass.

,2,"Step 1: Assess the Patient's Risk & Resource Needs - The patient is a 72-year-old female with altered mental status (disoriented to time and place) and symptoms suggestive of a urinary tract infection (fever and dysuria). Altered mental status in an elderly patient can indicate a serious underlying condition, such as sepsis, which requires prompt evaluation and treatment. Step 2: Analyze and Compare with Other Patient Cases - Comparing with other cases, altered mental status in the elderly, especially with potential infection, is treated with higher acuity. For example, the 4-year-old with a ventriculo-peritoneal shunt and altered behavior was assigned an ESI level of 2. Step 3: Determine the ESI acuity level for this patient based on the examples and your assessment of the patient's clinical presentation - Given the patient's age, altered mental status, and potential for a serious infection, this patient requires prompt evaluation and likely multiple resources, such as labs, imaging, and IV antibiotics.

Next thing you know, my penis was flaccid, and I noticed some bruising.” The pain is “unbelievable,” 20/10. No meds, No known drug allergies.","ESI level 2: High risk. This patient may be describing a penile fracture, a medical emergency. It is most often caused by blunt trauma to an erect penis. This patient needs to be evaluated promptly.",2
,1,"Step 1: Assess the Patient's Risk & Resource Needs - The patient is a 72-year-old female with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and increased work of breathing, indicating respiratory distress. Her SpO2 is critically low at 79%, which is a life-threatening condition requiring immediate intervention to prevent respiratory failure. Step 2: Analyze and Compare with Other Patient Cases - Comparing with the example of the 18-year-old female with a suspected medication overdose and SpO2 of 86%, who was assigned an ESI level of 1, this patient is in a similar or more severe condition due to her age and underlying COPD. Step 3: Determine the ESI acuity level - Given the critical nature of her low oxygen saturation and respiratory distress, this patient requires immediate life-saving intervention, such as oxygen therapy or advanced airway management. Therefore, the appropriate ESI acuity level is 1.","A 72-year-old female with obvious chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and increased work of breathing is wheeled into triage. Between breaths, she tells you that she “is having a hard time breathing and has had a fever since yesterday.” The SpO2 monitor is alarming and displaying a saturation of 79 percent.","ESI  level  1:  Requires   immediate lifesaving intervention.   Immediate aggressive airway management is what this patient requires. Her saturation is very low, and she appears to be tiring. The triage nurse does not need the other vital signs in order to decide that this patient needs immediate care.",1
,5,"Step 1: Assess the Patient's Risk & Resource Needs - The patient stepped on a rusty nail and is concerned about tetanus. There is no immediate life threat or need for multiple resources. Step 2: Analyze and Compare with Other Patient Cases - Similar cases, such as stepping on a rusty nail, have been assigned an ESI level of 5, indicating minimal resource needs and non-urgent care. Step 3: Determine the ESI acuity level for this patient based on the examples and your assessment of the patient's clinical presentation - The patient requires a tetanus shot, which is a single resource, and there is no indication of urgency or complexity.","“I think I need a tetanus shot,” a 29-year-old female tells you. “I stepped on a rusty nail this morning, and I know I haven’t had one for years.” No past medical history, No known drug allergies, no medications.",ESI level 5: No resources. A tetanus immunization does not count as a resource. The patient will be seen by a physician or midlevel provider and receive a tetanus immunization and discharge instructions. This patient will require no resources.,5
,3,"Step 1: Assess the Patient's Risk & Resource Needs - The patient is a 63-year-old male who is cachectic and usually unresponsive, indicating a high level of baseline medical complexity. The immediate issue is the dislodgement of a feeding tube, which is critical for his nutrition and hydration. However, there is no indication of immediate life-threatening conditions such as compromised airway, breathing, or circulation. Step 2: Analyze and Compare with Other Patient Cases - Comparing with other cases, such as the 3-week-old with projectile vomiting (Acuity Level 3) and the 4-year-old with a ventriculo-peritoneal shunt concern (Acuity Level 2), this patient requires timely intervention to replace the feeding tube but does not present with acute distress or instability. Step 3: Determine the ESI acuity level - The patient requires intervention to replace the feeding tube, which is a resource-intensive process but not immediately life-threatening. Therefore, the acuity level is likely between 2 and 3. Given the patient's complex medical history and the need for timely intervention, an ESI level of 3 is appropriate.",A 63-year-old cachectic male is brought in from the local nursing  home because his feeding tube fell out again. The patient is usually unresponsive. He has been in the nursing home since he suffered a massive stroke about 4 years ago.,"ESI level 4: One  resource. This patient  will be sent back to the nursing home after the feeding tube is reinserted. There is no acute change in his medical condition that warrants any further evaluation. He is unresponsive, but that is the patient’s baseline mental status so he is not an ESI level 1.",4
,2,"Step 1: Assess the Patient's Risk & Resource Needs - The patient has a history of severe shellfish allergy and experienced throat closure, a sign of anaphylaxis, after consuming shrimp. He used his EpiPen, which is a life-saving intervention, and currently feels okay. However, anaphylaxis can have a biphasic reaction, meaning symptoms can return after initial treatment. Step 2: Analyze and Compare with Other Patient Cases - In the examples, patients with potential life-threatening conditions, such as the 21-year-old female with a rapid heart rate and low blood pressure, were assigned ESI 1. The patient with a suspected medication overdose and low SpO2 was also assigned ESI 1. Step 3: Determine the ESI acuity level for this patient - Although the patient currently feels okay, the potential for a biphasic reaction and the initial severity of the allergic reaction warrant close monitoring and possible intervention. Therefore, the patient should be assigned an ESI level of 2, as he is at high risk for deterioration and requires monitoring and potential intervention.","A 28-year-old male presents to the ED requesting to be checked. He has a severe shellfish allergy and mistakenly ate a dip that contained shrimp. He immediately felt his throat start to close, so he used his EpiPen. He tells you that he feels okay.

,3,"Step 1: Assess the Patient's Risk & Resource Needs - The 19-month-old has a 2-centimeter lip laceration that extends through the vermilion border. This type of laceration may require careful repair to ensure proper healing and cosmetic outcome, potentially involving a specialist such as a plastic surgeon. The vital signs are within normal limits, indicating no immediate life-threatening issues. Step 2: Analyze and Compare with Other Patient Cases - Comparing with other cases, such as the 6-year-old with a knee laceration (Acuity Level 4) and the 28-year-old with a finger laceration (Acuity Level 4), this case is more complex due to the involvement of the vermilion border, which may require more specialized resources. Step 3: Determine the ESI acuity level - Given the need for potential specialist intervention and the complexity of the laceration, this case is more resource-intensive than a simple laceration but not life-threatening, suggesting an ESI level of 3.","“He was running after his brother, fell, and cut his lip on the corner of the coffee table. There was blood everywhere,” recalls the mother of a healthy 19-month-old. “He’ll never stay still for the doctor.” You notice that the baby has a 2- centimeter lip laceration that extends through the vermilion border. Vital signs are within normal limits for age.","ESI level 3: Two or more resources. A laceration through the vermilion border requires the physician to line up the edges exactly. Misalignment can be noticeable. A healthy 19-month-old will probably not cooperate. In most settings, he will require conscious sedation, which counts as two resources. The toddler’s vital signs are within normal limits for his age, so there is no reason to up-triage to ESI level 2.",3
,2,"Step 1: Assess the Patient's Risk & Resource Needs - The patient is a 44-year-old female with diabetes who has been vomiting for 5 hours and is now retching continuously. She has not eaten or taken her insulin, which poses a risk for diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) or severe dehydration. Her vital signs show tachycardia (P 126) and tachypnea (RR 24), indicating potential metabolic acidosis or dehydration. Step 2: Analyze and Compare with Other Patient Cases - Comparing with other cases, such as the 21-year-old female with a rapid heart rate and low BP (Acuity Level 1) and the 8-month-old with fever, cough, and vomiting (Acuity Level 2), this patient is at risk of a serious condition due to her diabetes and current symptoms.

,1,"Step 1: Assess the Patient's Risk & Resource Needs - The patient is a 76-year-old male with a history of atrial fibrillation and is on anticoagulation therapy (likely the 'little blue pill'). He was found on the bathroom floor with maroon-colored stool in the toilet, indicating a possible gastrointestinal bleed. His vital signs are concerning: BP 70/palp (indicating hypotension), HR 128 (tachycardia), and RR 40 (tachypnea). These signs suggest he is in shock, likely hypovolemic due to the bleed, and requires immediate intervention. Step 2: Analyze and Compare with Other Patient Cases - Comparing with other cases, such as the 17-year-old with a gunshot wound and the 21-year-old female with rapid heart rate and low BP, both of which were assigned ESI level 1, this patient also presents with life-threatening conditions requiring immediate intervention. Step 3: Determine the ESI acuity level for this patient based on the examples and your assessment of the patient's clinical presentation - Given the patient's critical condition, hypotension, tachycardia, and potential for significant blood loss, he requires immediate life-saving intervention, such as fluid resuscitation and possibly blood transfusion. Therefore, the appropriate ESI level is 1.","EMS arrives with a 76-year-old male found on the bathroom floor. The  family  called  911 when they heard a loud crash in the bathroom.

Her vital signs are within normal limits, indicating no immediate life-threatening condition. However, her pain is severe and requires urgent intervention to manage. Step 2: Analyze and Compare with Other Patient Cases - Comparing with other cases, patients with severe pain and chronic conditions like cancer often require more resources for pain management and potential adjustment of medication. Cases with severe pain but stable vital signs, such as the healthy middle-aged man with a table saw injury (Acuity Level 3), suggest a similar level of urgency. Step 3: Determine the ESI acuity level for this patient based on the examples and your assessment of the patient's clinical presentation - Given the severe pain and the need for intervention to manage it, but with stable vital signs, the patient is likely to require multiple resources for pain management and possibly further evaluation of her cancer treatment. Therefore, the appropriate ESI level is 3.","“My pain medications are not working anymore. Last night I couldn’t sleep because the pain was so bad,” reports a 47-year-old female with metastatic ovarian cancer. “My husband called my oncologist, and he told me to come to the emergency department.” The patient rates her pain as 9/10.

The primary purpose of this visit is to ensure proper healing of the boil, which is a routine follow-up. There is no indication of acute distress or need for immediate intervention. The patient's condition is stable, and he is not expected to require multiple resources. This scenario is similar to cases where patients are seen for follow-up or minor issues, which are typically assigned a lower acuity level.","“The doctor told me to come back this morning and have my boil checked. He lanced it yesterday and packed some stuff in it. He said he just want to make sure it is healing OK,” reports a 54-year-old diabetic male. The patient goes on to tell you that he feels so much better. T 98°F, RR 16, HR 64, BP 142/78, SpO2 98%. Pain 2/10.","ESI level 5: No resources. This patient was instructed to come back to the emergency department for a wound check. He will be examined and discharged to home. No resources are required. A point-of-care finger stick glucose is indicated, but this is not a resource. If the patient came back with a fever or increasing pain and redness, then his ESI level would reflect the additional resources he would require.",5
,2,"Step 1: Assess the Patient's Risk & Resource Needs - The patient is a 43-year-old female with a history of asthma, currently experiencing wheezing and fever. Her rescue inhaler is not providing relief, indicating a potential exacerbation of asthma. Vital signs show a fever (T 101.4°F), slightly elevated respiratory rate (RR 26), normal heart rate (HR 90), normal blood pressure (BP 138/70), and slightly reduced oxygen saturation (SpO2 95%). The patient is not in immediate life-threatening distress but requires medical intervention to manage her asthma exacerbation. Step 2: Analyze and Compare with Other Patient Cases - Comparing with similar cases, such as the 19-year-old male with shortness of breath and SpO2 92% who was assigned ESI level 2, this patient also presents with respiratory distress due to asthma exacerbation. The patient with a fractured wrist and decreased circulation was also assigned ESI level 2, indicating that conditions requiring timely intervention but not immediate life-saving measures are typically assigned this level. Step 3: Determine the ESI acuity level for this patient based on the examples and your assessment of the patient's clinical presentation - Given the patient's respiratory distress due to asthma exacerbation and the need for medical intervention, the appropriate ESI level is 2.","“I have been wheezing for a few days, and  today I woke up with a fever. My rescue inhaler doesn’t seem to be helping,” reports a 43-year- old female with a past history of asthma. Vital signs: T 101.4°F, RR 26, HR 90, BP 138/70, SpO2 95%.","ESI level 3: Two or more resources. This patient has a history of asthma that is not responding to her rescue inhaler. In addition, she has a fever. At a minimum, she will need two resources: hand-held nebulizer treatments and a chest x ray.",3
,2,"Step 1: Assess the Patient's Risk & Resource Needs - The patient experienced a sudden loss of vision in one eye, which resolved after 5 minutes. This could indicate a transient ischemic attack (TIA) or other serious neurological or vascular event. Given the patient's history of hypertension and high cholesterol, he is at increased risk for such events. Immediate evaluation is necessary to rule out a stroke or other serious condition. Step 2: Analyze and Compare with Other Patient Cases - Comparing with other cases, sudden neurological symptoms like the 21-year-old female with a rapid heart rate and chest pressure (Acuity Level 1) or the 4-year-old with a fall and unconsciousness (Acuity Level 2) require prompt attention. The patient's symptoms are less severe than those requiring immediate life-saving intervention (ESI 1) but are urgent enough to require rapid evaluation and intervention. Step 3: Determine the ESI acuity level for this patient based on the examples and your assessment of the patient's clinical presentation - The patient's symptoms and risk factors suggest an urgent need for evaluation, similar to cases assigned ESI 2.","“I was having breakfast with my wife, and all of a sudden I couldn’t see out of my right eye. It lasted about 5 minutes. I’m just scared because I’ve never had anything like this happen  before,” reports a 56-year-old male with a history of HTN and high cholesterol.","ESI level 2: High risk. This patient is exhibiting signs of central retinal artery occlusion, which represents an acute threat to loss of vision. Rapid evaluation is necessary.",2
,4,"The patient is a 43-year-old female who twisted her ankle. She reports significant pain (8/10), but there are no signs of life-threatening conditions or need for immediate intervention. Her vital signs are stable, and there is no indication of systemic issues or high-risk factors. The primary concern is pain management and possibly imaging to rule out a fracture. This scenario is similar to cases where patients have minor injuries or require minimal resources, such as the 6-year-old with a knee laceration (Acuity Level 4) or the 28-year-old with a finger laceration (Acuity Level 4). Therefore, the patient likely requires one or two resources, such as an X-ray and pain management, but does not require immediate life-saving intervention or pose a high risk of deterioration.","“I was walking down the street and twisted my ankle as I stepped off the curb. I don’t think it’s broken, but it hurts so much,” report a 43-year- old female with a history of colitis. Vital signs:  T 98°F, HR 72, RR 18, BP 134/80, SpO2 100%. Pain 8/10.","ESI level 4: One resource. To rule out a fracture, this patient will require an x ray, one resource. The application of a splint and crutch walking instructions are not counted as resources. This patient does not meet the criteria for ESI level 2 for pain because nursing can immediately initiate interventions to address her pain.",4
,4,"Step 1: Assess the Patient's Risk & Resource Needs - The patient is experiencing a flare-up of colitis, characterized by increased stools and cramping. Her vital signs are stable, and she is not in immediate distress. The pain level is moderate at 6/10. Step 2: Analyze and Compare with Other Patient Cases - Comparing with other cases, such as the 10-year-old with constipation (Acuity Level 4) and the 7-year-old with a stomach ache (Acuity Level 3), this patient is more similar to the constipation case due to stable vitals and no immediate life-threatening symptoms. Step 3: Determine the ESI acuity level - The patient requires evaluation and possibly some diagnostic tests or treatment for her colitis flare-up, but there is no indication of immediate life-threatening conditions or high resource needs. Therefore, the appropriate ESI level is 4.","“My colitis is acting up,” report a 26-year-old female. “It started with an increased number of stools, and now I am cramping a lot. My gastroenterologist told me to come to the emergency department to be evaluated.” No other past medical history. T 97°F, RR 18, HR 68, BP 112/76, SpO2 100%.

,3,"Step 1: Assess the Patient's Risk & Resource Needs - The patient is experiencing a sickle cell crisis, which is a painful episode that requires medical intervention. However, her vital signs are stable, and she does not have any life-threatening symptoms. Step 2: Analyze and Compare with Other Patient Cases - Similar cases, such as patients with severe pain but stable vital signs, have been assigned an ESI level of 3. Step 3: Determine the ESI acuity level for this patient based on the examples and your assessment of the patient's clinical presentation - The patient requires pain management and possibly other interventions to manage the sickle cell crisis, but she is not in immediate danger. Therefore, the appropriate ESI level is 3.","A 46-year-old female with a history of sickle cell disease presents to the emergency department because of a crisis. She has pain in her lower legs that began 8 hours ago, and the pain medication she is taking is not working. Currently, she rates her pain as 8/10. She has no other medical problems, and her current medications include folate and vicodin. Vital signs are all within normal limits.","ESI level 2: High risk. Sickle cell disease requires immediate medical attention because of the severity of the patient’s pain, which is caused by the sickle cells occluding small and sometimes large blood vessels. Rapid analgesic management will help prevent the crisis from progressing to the point where hospitalization will be unavoidable.",2
,3,"Step 1: Assess the Patient's Risk & Resource Needs - The patient is on a blood thinner and presents with pain and swelling in the lower leg, which could indicate a possible deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or another clotting issue. This condition requires further investigation and possibly imaging studies to confirm the diagnosis. Step 2: Analyze and Compare with Other Patient Cases - Comparing with other cases, such as the 19-year-old with a rapid heart rate and low blood pressure (Acuity Level 1) or the 4-year-old with a ventriculo-peritoneal shunt concern (Acuity Level 2), this patient does not require immediate life-saving intervention but does need timely evaluation to prevent complications. Step 3: Determine the ESI acuity level for this patient based on the examples and your assessment of the patient's clinical presentation - The patient requires more than one resource (e.g., imaging, lab tests) to evaluate the potential clotting issue, but there is no immediate threat to life or limb. Therefore, the appropriate ESI level is 3.","“I take a blood thinner because I have had clots in my legs,” reports a 54-year-old black male. “They told me that medicine would prevent them, but today I have pain and swelling in my lower leg. It started out just being sore, but now I can hardly walk on it.” Denies any other complaints. Vital signs within normal limits.",ESI level 3: Two or more resources.

,2,"Step 1: Assess the Patient's Risk & Resource Needs - The patient is a 26-year-old female with a history of previous suicide attempts, currently experiencing increased alcohol consumption and insomnia. She admits to thinking about self-harm, although she has no specific plan. Her vital signs are within normal limits. The primary concern here is the potential risk of self-harm, which requires a mental health evaluation and possibly psychiatric intervention. Step 2: Analyze and Compare with Other Patient Cases - Comparing with other cases, patients with suicidal ideation or mental health crises without immediate life-threatening conditions are often assigned an ESI level of 2. For example, the 17-year-old handcuffed male with behavioral issues and the 23-year-old male escorted by police both received an ESI level of 2. Step 3: Determine the ESI acuity level for this patient based on the examples and your assessment of the patient's clinical presentation - Given the patient's suicidal ideation and history of suicide attempts, she requires urgent mental health evaluation and intervention, which aligns with an ESI level of 2.","26-year-old female presents to the ED because she can’t get an appointment  with  her therapist. She went home for the holidays, and the visit brought back many issues from her childhood. She is unable to sleep and has been drinking more than usual.

This patient is a danger to herself and needs to be placed in a safe environment with a constant observer.,2
,5,"The patient is a 58-year-old male who has forgotten to pack his blood pressure medication and has not taken it for 2 days. His vital signs show a slightly elevated blood pressure (154/88), but his heart rate, respiratory rate, temperature, and oxygen saturation are within normal limits. He is not experiencing any acute symptoms or distress. The situation is similar to the example of the 13-year-old male who was out of his ADHD medication, which was assigned an ESI level of 5. This indicates that the patient requires minimal resources and is not in immediate danger.","“I am here on business for a week, and I forgot to pack my blood pressure  medication.  I haven’t taken it for 2 days. Do you think one of the doctors will write me a prescription?” asks a 58-year-old male. BP 154/88, HR 64, RR 18, T 98°F, SpO2 99%.",ESI level 5: No resources. The patient  will need a history and physical exam and then will be discharged to home with a prescription. An oral dose of his blood pressure medication does not count as a resource.,5
,5,"The patient is a 42-year-old female who fell while running for the bus. She reports no pain and only has superficial injuries described as 'road burn' on both knees. She believes she needs a tetanus booster. Her vital signs are within normal limits. Based on the ESI examples, patients with minor injuries and no significant risk factors or need for multiple resources are typically assigned a lower acuity level. For instance, a patient who stepped on a rusty nail and required a tetanus shot was assigned an ESI level of 5. Similarly, this patient has minor injuries and is requesting a tetanus booster, which aligns with minimal resource needs and low acuity.","“I fell running for the bus,” reports a 42-year- old female. “Nothing hurts, I just have road burn on both my knees, and I think I need a tetanus booster.” Vital signs within normal limits.","ESI level 5: No resources. A tetanus booster is not a resource, and neither is cleaning and dressing abrasions.",5
,1,"Step 1: Assess the Patient's Risk & Resource Needs - The patient has a gunshot wound to the chest, which is a critical injury. The vital signs indicate hemodynamic instability with hypotension (BP 78/palp), tachycardia (HR 148), and tachypnea (RR 36).
