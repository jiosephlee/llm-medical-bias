His vital signs are within normal limits, indicating no immediate risk or instability. He is seeking a prescription refill, which is a non-urgent request. Step 2: Analyze and Compare with Similar Patient Cases - Similar cases include patients seeking non-urgent care, such as a physical for camp or a tetanus shot after stepping on a nail, both of which were assigned an ESI level of 5. Step 3: Determine the ESI acuity level for this patient based on the examples and your assessment of the patient's clinical presentation - Given the non-urgent nature of the request and the stable vital signs, the patient requires minimal resources and is not at risk of deterioration. Therefore, the appropriate ESI level is 5.","“I ran out of my blood pressure medicine, and my doctor is on vacation. Can someone here write me a prescription?” requests a 56-year-old male with a history of HTN. Vital signs: BP 128/84, HR 76, RR 16, T 97˚F.","ESI level  5: No resources. The patient needs  a prescription refill and has no other medical complaints. His blood pressure is controlled with his current medication. If at triage his blood pressure was 188/124 and he complained of a headache,, then he would meet the criteria for a high-risk situation and be assigned to ESI level 2. If this patient’s BP was elevated and the patient had no complaints, he or she would remain an ESI level 5. The blood pressure would be repeated and would most likely not be  treated in the ED or treated with PO medications.",5
,3,"Step 1: Assess the Patient's Risk & Resource Needs - The patient is a 41-year-old male who was involved in a bicycle accident. He is ambulatory and walked into the emergency department, indicating he is stable. He is complaining of pain in the wrist area and has a 2-centimeter laceration on his left elbow. There is no mention of any life-threatening conditions or need for immediate life-saving interventions. Step 2: Analyze and Compare with Similar Patient Cases - Comparing with similar cases, such as the 19-year-old male involved in a bicycle accident with a laceration and clavicle pain (Acuity Level 3), and the 18-year-old with a hand injury from a table saw (Acuity Level 3), this patient also presents with a non-life-threatening injury that requires evaluation and treatment but is not critical. Step 3: Determine the ESI acuity level for this patient based on the examples and your assessment of the patient's clinical presentation - The patient is stable, has a minor laceration, and is experiencing pain in the wrist area, which may require imaging and treatment. Based on the examples and the patient's presentation, the appropriate ESI acuity level is 3.","A 41-year-old male involved in a bicycle accident walks into the emergency department with his right arm in a sling.

At a minimum, this patient will require an x ray of his right arm and suturing of his left elbow laceration.",3
,2,"Step 1: Assess the Patient's Risk & Resource Needs - The patient is experiencing shortness of breath with a respiratory rate of 32, which is elevated, and an SpO2 of 93%, indicating mild hypoxemia. These signs suggest a potential respiratory compromise. Step 2: Analyze and Compare with Similar Patient Cases - Comparing with the example of a 21-year-old female with a rapid heart rate and low blood pressure, who was assigned ESI 1 due to signs of shock, this patient does not exhibit signs of shock but does have respiratory distress. The example of a 19-year-old female with a sore throat and fever, assigned ESI 4, shows that this patient's respiratory distress is more severe. Step 3: Determine the ESI acuity level - Given the patient's respiratory distress and hypoxemia, she requires prompt evaluation and potential intervention, such as oxygen therapy, to prevent further deterioration. This aligns with an ESI level of 2, which is for patients who are at high risk and require urgent intervention.","A 32-year-old female presents to the emergency department complaining of shortness of breath for several hours.

,3,"Step 1: Assess the Patient's Risk & Resource Needs - The patient is a 60-year-old male with a painful, red, warm, swollen, and tender right foot, which suggests an inflammatory or infectious process. He has a history of type 2 diabetes, which increases the risk of complications such as infections. However, his vital signs are stable, and there is no immediate life-threatening condition. Step 2: Analyze and Compare with Similar Patient Cases - Comparing with similar cases, such as the 19-year-old with a belly button infection (Acuity Level 3) and the 10-year-old with abdominal pain and constipation (Acuity Level 4), this patient requires medical evaluation and possibly imaging or lab tests to rule out infection or other complications. Step 3: Determine the ESI acuity level - Given the stable vital signs and the need for further evaluation and potential treatment, the patient is likely to require more than one resource, such as lab tests and imaging, but does not have a high-risk situation or need immediate intervention. Therefore, the appropriate ESI level is 3.","A 60-year-old man requests to see a doctor because his right foot hurts. On exam the great toe and foot skin is red, warm, swollen, and tender to touch.

,2,"Step 1: Assess the Patient's Risk & Resource Needs - The patient is a 23-year-old female who is experiencing shortness of breath upon exertion and has swollen ankles. These symptoms could indicate a potential cardiac issue, such as heart failure, especially considering the recent childbirth and obesity. The symptoms are concerning and require further evaluation to rule out serious conditions. Step 2: Analyze and Compare with Similar Patient Cases - Comparing with other cases, such as the 21-year-old female with a rapid heart rate and chest pressure (ESI 1), this case is less acute as the patient is not in immediate distress. However, it is more concerning than cases with minor injuries or non-urgent conditions (ESI 4 or 5). Step 3: Determine the ESI acuity level for this patient based on the examples and your assessment of the patient's clinical presentation - Given the potential for a serious underlying condition, the need for diagnostic testing, and the patient's symptoms, an ESI level of 2 is appropriate.

She vomited twice this morning. past medical history: migraines, no allergies, medications include Fioricet.","ESI level 3: Two or more resources. At a minimum, this patient will require an IV with fluid, IV pain medication, and an antiemetic. Although she rates her pain as 20/10, she should not be assigned to ESI level 2. She has had the pain for 2 days, and the triage nurse can’t justify giving the last open bed to this patient. The triage nurse will need to address this patient’s concerns about wait time.",3
,2,"Step 1: Assess the Patient's Risk & Resource Needs - The patient has a self-inflicted neck laceration, which is a significant injury, but the bleeding is currently controlled. The patient is hemodynamically stable with normal vital signs. However, the context of the injury suggests a potential risk for further self-harm or underlying mental health issues. Step 2: Analyze and Compare with Similar Patient Cases - Comparing with similar cases, such as the 16-year-old female with a suspected overdose (Acuity Level 2) and the 23-year-old male with mental health issues (Acuity Level 2), both cases involve stable vital signs but significant underlying risks. Step 3: Determine the ESI acuity level for this patient based on the examples and your assessment of the patient's clinical presentation - Given the controlled bleeding and stable vital signs, but considering the potential for self-harm and the need for mental health evaluation, the patient should be assigned an ESI acuity level of 2.","EMS arrives with a 75-year-old male with a self- inflicted 6-centimeter laceration to his neck.

,2,"Step 1: Assess the Patient's Risk & Resource Needs - The patient is a 72-year-old female with altered mental status (disoriented to time and place) and symptoms suggestive of a urinary tract infection (fever and dysuria). Altered mental status in an elderly patient can indicate a serious underlying condition, such as sepsis, especially when combined with fever. Step 2: Analyze and Compare with Similar Patient Cases - In the examples, cases with altered mental status, especially in the context of potential infection, are often assigned a higher acuity level. For instance, the 8-month-old with fever and listlessness was assigned an ESI level of 2. Step 3: Determine the ESI acuity level for this patient based on the examples and your assessment of the patient's clinical presentation - Given the patient's age, altered mental status, and potential for a serious infection, this patient requires prompt evaluation and intervention, likely involving multiple resources. Therefore, an ESI level of 2 is appropriate.","“My mother is just not acting herself,” reports the daughter of a 72-year-old female. She is sleeping more than usual and complains that it hurts to pee.” Vital signs: T 100.8˚F, HR 98, RR 22, BP 122/80. The patient responds to verbal stimuli but is disoriented to time and place.","ESI  level  2:  New  onset  confusion, lethargy, or disorientation. The daughter reports that her mother has a change in level of consciousness. The reason for her change in mental status may be a UTI that has advanced to bacteremia.

She is currently on antibiotics for a UTI. Her vital signs are within normal range, and there are no other complaints. The primary issue is the dislodged Foley catheter, which is not life-threatening and does not require immediate intervention. Step 2: Analyze and Compare with Similar Patient Cases - Comparing with similar cases, such as the patient with a cuticle infection (Acuity Level 4) or the patient needing a tetanus shot after stepping on a nail (Acuity Level 5), this situation is more akin to a non-urgent issue that requires minimal resources. Step 3: Determine the ESI acuity level - Given the non-urgent nature of the problem and the stable condition of the patient, the appropriate ESI level is 4, as it requires some intervention but is not life-threatening.","EMS arrives in the ED with a 57-year-old female with multiple sclerosis. She is bedridden, and her family provides care in the home.  The family called 911 because her Foley catheter came out this morning. No other complaints.

He is oriented to person, place, and time, with a Glasgow Coma Scale score of 14, indicating mild impairment. The primary concerns are the laceration and potential complications from alcohol intoxication. Step 2: Analyze and Compare with Similar Patient Cases - Comparing with similar cases, such as the 29-year-old male with a rectal foreign body (Acuity Level 3) and the 18-year-old male with sawdust in the eye (Acuity Level 4), the current patient has a more significant injury due to the laceration and potential for complications from intoxication. Step 3: Determine the ESI acuity level for this patient based on the examples and your assessment of the patient's clinical presentation - The patient requires medical attention for the laceration and monitoring for alcohol intoxication, but is not in immediate life-threatening danger. Therefore, an ESI acuity level of 3 is appropriate, as the patient will likely require multiple resources for treatment and monitoring.","“Why the hell don’t you just leave me alone?” yells a 73-year-old disheveled male who was brought to the ED by EMS.

,2,"The patient presents with a suspected penile fracture, which is a urological emergency. The description of a 'crack' sound followed by immediate flaccidity and bruising is highly indicative of this condition. The pain level is extremely high at 20/10, suggesting severe distress. Although the patient's vital signs are not provided, the nature of the injury itself requires urgent evaluation and likely surgical intervention to prevent long-term complications. Comparing this case to other examples, such as the 20-year-old male with a dislocated shoulder (Acuity Level 2), the need for immediate intervention is similar. Therefore, the acuity level should reflect the urgency of the situation.","“This is so embarrassing,” reports a 42-year-old male. “We were having incredible sex, and I heard a crack. Next thing you know, my penis was flaccid, and I noticed some bruising.” The pain is “unbelievable,” 20/10. No meds, No known drug allergies.","ESI level 2: High risk.

,3,"Step 1: Assess the Patient's Risk & Resource Needs - The patient is a 63-year-old male who is cachectic and usually unresponsive, indicating a high level of baseline medical complexity. The immediate issue is the dislodgement of a feeding tube, which is critical for his nutrition and hydration. However, there is no indication of immediate life-threatening conditions such as respiratory distress or hemodynamic instability. Step 2: Analyze and Compare with Similar Patient Cases - Similar cases involve patients with chronic conditions or those requiring specific interventions but not immediate life-saving measures. For example, a patient with a blocked shunt or a dislocated shoulder requiring reduction. Step 3: Determine the ESI acuity level for this patient based on the examples and your assessment of the patient's clinical presentation - The patient requires intervention to replace the feeding tube, which is a resource-intensive procedure but not immediately life-threatening.

,3,"The patient is a healthy 19-month-old with a 2-centimeter lip laceration that extends through the vermilion border. The vital signs are within normal limits for age. The primary concern here is the laceration, which may require suturing, especially since it involves the vermilion border, which is cosmetically significant. The child is otherwise healthy and stable, with no signs of systemic illness or distress. Based on the examples, similar cases involving lacerations or injuries that require some medical intervention but are not life-threatening are typically assigned an ESI level of 3 or 4. Given the need for potential suturing and the involvement of the vermilion border, which may require more careful cosmetic repair, this case is more aligned with an ESI level of 3, as it will likely require more than one resource (e.g., suturing, possibly sedation for the procedure).","“He was running after his brother, fell, and cut his lip on the corner of the coffee table. There was blood everywhere,” recalls the mother of a healthy 19-month-old. “He’ll never stay still for the doctor.” You notice that the baby has a 2- centimeter lip laceration that extends through the vermilion border. Vital signs are within normal limits for age.","ESI level 3: Two or more resources. A laceration through the vermilion border requires the physician to line up the edges exactly. Misalignment can be noticeable. A healthy 19-month-old will probably not cooperate. In most settings, he will require conscious sedation, which counts as two resources.
