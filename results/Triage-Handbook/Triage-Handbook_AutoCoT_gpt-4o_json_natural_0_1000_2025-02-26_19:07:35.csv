His vital signs are within normal limits: blood pressure is 128/84, heart rate is 76, respiratory rate is 16, and temperature is 97°F. There is no indication of acute distress or life-threatening condition. The patient does not require immediate life-saving intervention, and his condition is stable. He is seeking a prescription refill, which is a non-urgent request. The patient will likely require minimal resources, such as a brief evaluation and prescription writing.","“I ran out of my blood pressure medicine, and my doctor is on vacation. Can someone here write me a prescription?” requests a 56-year-old male with a history of HTN. Vital signs: BP 128/84, HR 76, RR 16, T 97˚F.","ESI level  5: No resources. The patient needs  a prescription refill and has no other medical complaints. His blood pressure is controlled with his current medication. If at triage his blood pressure was 188/124 and he complained of a headache,, then he would meet the criteria for a high-risk situation and be assigned to ESI level 2. If this patient’s BP was elevated and the patient had no complaints, he or she would remain an ESI level 5. The blood pressure would be repeated and would most likely not be  treated in the ED or treated with PO medications.",5
,3,"The patient is a 41-year-old male who was involved in a bicycle accident. He is ambulatory and walked into the emergency department, indicating that he is stable and does not require immediate life-saving intervention, ruling out ESI level 1. He is complaining of pain in the wrist area and has a 2-centimeter laceration on his left elbow. The laceration and wrist pain suggest the need for medical evaluation and treatment, but there is no indication of a high-risk situation such as severe hemorrhage, altered mental status, or respiratory distress, which would necessitate ESI level 2. The patient will likely require resources such as an X-ray to assess for fractures and wound care for the laceration, which aligns with ESI level 3, as he will need multiple resources. There is no indication of a life-threatening condition or need for immediate intervention, and the patient is stable, so ESI levels 4 and 5, which are for less resource-intensive cases, are not appropriate.","A 41-year-old male involved in a bicycle accident walks into the emergency department with his right arm in a sling. He tells you that he fell off his bike and landed on his right arm. His is complaining of pain in the wrist area and has a 2-centimeter laceration on his left elbow. “My helmet saved me,” he tells you.","ESI level 3: Two or more resources. At a minimum, this patient will require an x ray of his right arm and suturing of his left elbow laceration.",3
,2,"The patient is a 32-year-old female presenting with shortness of breath, which is a concerning symptom. Her respiratory rate is elevated at 32 breaths per minute, indicating respiratory distress. Her oxygen saturation is 93% on room air, which is below normal and suggests hypoxemia. Although her heart rate and blood pressure are within normal limits, the combination of tachypnea and low oxygen saturation requires prompt attention. She does not require immediate life-saving intervention (ESI 1), but she is at risk of further deterioration and likely needs supplemental oxygen and further evaluation. Therefore, she should be prioritized for rapid assessment and treatment.","A 32-year-old female presents to the emergency department complaining of shortness of breath for several hours. No past medical history, +smoker. Vital signs: RR 32, HR 96, BP 126/80, SpO2 93% on room air, T 98.6˚F. No allergies, current medications include vitamins and birth control pills.","ESI level 2:  High  risk. This 32-year-old female with new-onset shortness of breath is on birth control pills. She is a smoker and is exhibiting signs and symptoms of respiratory distress (SpO2 and respiratory rate.) Based on history and signs and symptoms, a pulmonary embolus, as well as other potential causes for her respiratory distress, must be ruled out.",2
,4,"The patient is a 60-year-old man with a painful, red, warm, swollen, and tender right foot and great toe. He has a history of type 2 diabetes and psoriasis. His vital signs are relatively stable: temperature is slightly elevated at 99.4˚F, respiratory rate is 18, heart rate is 82, blood pressure is 146/70, and SpO2 is 99%. The presentation suggests a possible infection, such as cellulitis, which is common in diabetic patients. However, there is no indication of immediate life-threatening conditions or the need for immediate life-saving interventions, ruling out ESI level 1. The patient is stable and does not appear to be in severe distress, which would rule out ESI level 2. The condition is not likely to require multiple resources for diagnosis and treatment, such as imaging or multiple lab tests, which would suggest an ESI level of 3. The patient will likely need an evaluation and possibly a prescription for antibiotics, which aligns with ESI level 4, as it involves one resource (a prescription). ESI level 5 is not appropriate as the patient does require some medical intervention.","A 60-year-old man requests to see a doctor because his right foot hurts. On exam the great toe and foot skin is red, warm, swollen, and tender to touch. He denies injury. past medical history includes type 2 diabetes, and psoriasis. Vital signs: T 99.4˚F, RR 18, HR 82, BP 146/70, SpO2 99%.","ESI level 3: Two or more resources. This patient has a significant medical history, and based on his presentation, he will require two or more resources, which could include labs and IV antibiotics.",3
,5,"The patient is a 52-year-old female presenting with symptoms suggestive of a urinary tract infection, such as dysuria and frequency. She denies any abdominal pain or vaginal discharge, which suggests that the infection is likely uncomplicated. Her vital signs are within normal limits: temperature is 97.4˚F, heart rate is 78, respiratory rate is 14, and blood pressure is 142/70. She has no significant past medical history and no allergies. Based on the ESI criteria, she does not require immediate life-saving intervention (ESI 1), is not in a high-risk situation (ESI 2), and does not require multiple resources (ESI 3). The evaluation and treatment of a possible UTI typically involve minimal resources, such as a urinalysis and possibly a urine culture, which aligns with ESI 4 or 5. Since she is stable and the condition is non-urgent, ESI 5 is appropriate.","A 52-year-old female requests to see a doctor for a possible urinary tract infection (UTI). She is complaining of dysuria and frequency. She denies abdominal pain or vaginal discharge. No allergies, takes vitamins, and has no significant past medical history. Vital signs: T 97.4˚F, HR 78, RR 14, BP 142/70.","ESI level 4: One resource. She will need one resource – lab, which will include a urinalysis and urine culture. She most likely has a UTI that will be treated with oral medications.",4
,4,"The patient is a 34-year-old female, 3 months postpartum, presenting with symptoms suggestive of mastitis, including breast soreness, cracked nipples, and fever. Her vital signs show a fever of 102.8˚F, which indicates an infection, but her heart rate, respiratory rate, and blood pressure are within normal limits. She reports moderate pain (5/10). The patient is not in immediate danger and does not require life-saving intervention, ruling out ESI level 1. She is stable and does not require high resource intensity or immediate intervention, ruling out ESI level 2. The patient will likely need evaluation and treatment, possibly including antibiotics (considering her penicillin allergy), but this does not require multiple resources or immediate intervention, ruling out ESI level 3. The situation is more complex than a simple visit, as it involves an infection and potential treatment adjustments due to her allergy, which suggests more than one resource may be needed, ruling out ESI level 5. Therefore, the most appropriate ESI level is 4, as she will likely need a physical exam and possibly a prescription for antibiotics.","""My right breast is so sore, my nipples are cracked, and now I have a fever. Do you think I will have to stop nursing my baby?” asks a tearful 34-year-old female. She is 3 months post partum and has recently returned to work part- time. Vital signs: T 102.8˚F, HR 90, RR 18, BP 108/60, pain 5/10. No past medical history, taking multivitamins, and is allergic to penicillin.","ESI level 3: Two or more resources. At a minimum, she will require labs and IV antibiotics.",3
,3,"The patient is a 45-year-old woman with a history of asthma who has developed wheezing, cough, and fever. Her vital signs show a temperature of 101.6˚F, heart rate of 92, respiratory rate of 24, blood pressure of 148/86, and oxygen saturation of 97%. The key considerations for ESI triage are whether the patient requires immediate life-saving intervention, is in a high-risk situation, or how many resources she will need. The patient is not in immediate danger as her oxygen saturation is adequate at 97%, and she is not in respiratory distress requiring immediate intervention. However, her increased respiratory rate and history of asthma with current symptoms suggest she is at risk for deterioration. She will likely require multiple resources, such as nebulizer treatments, possibly a chest X-ray, and laboratory tests to assess her condition. Therefore, she is not ESI level 1 or 2, as she does not require immediate life-saving intervention or appear to be in a high-risk situation. Given the need for multiple resources, she is best categorized as ESI level 3.","EMS arrives with a 45-year-old woman with asthma who has had  a  cold  for  week.  She started wheezing a few days ago and then developed a cough and a fever of 103. Vital signs: T 101.6˚F, HR 92, RR 24, BP 148/86, SpO2 97%.","ESI level 3: Two or more resources. This history sounds more like pneumonia. Because the patient is not in acute respiratory distress, he or she doesn’t meet ESI level-2 criteria. This patient will require labs, a chest x ray, and perhaps IV antibiotics.",3
,3,"The patient is a 33-year-old female presenting with symptoms consistent with food poisoning, including vomiting and diarrhea. She reports abdominal cramping with a pain level of 5/10. Her vital signs are within normal limits: temperature is slightly below normal at 96.8˚F, heart rate is 96 bpm, respiratory rate is 16 breaths per minute, and blood pressure is 116/74 mmHg. She denies having a fever or chills. The patient is alert and oriented, and there is no indication of severe dehydration or hemodynamic instability. She does not require immediate life-saving intervention, and her condition does not appear to be high risk. The patient will likely require some resources, such as IV fluids or antiemetics, but not multiple complex resources. Therefore, she does not meet the criteria for ESI levels 1 or 2. Given the need for some resources and the absence of high-risk features, the appropriate ESI level is 3.","“I think I have food poisoning,” reports an otherwise healthy 33-year-old female. “I have been vomiting all night, and now I have diarrhea.” The patient admits to abdominal cramping that she rates as 5/10. She denies fever or chills. Vital signs: T 96.8˚F, HR 96, RR 16, BP 116/74.","ESI level 3: Two or more resources. Lab studies, IV fluid, and an IV antiemetic are three of the resources this patient will require. The patient is not high risk or in severe pain or distress.",3
,3,"The patient is a 37-year-old female with a history of migraines, presenting with a migraine that started early in the morning and is accompanied by persistent vomiting. Her vital signs are: temperature 98°F, respiratory rate 20, heart rate 102, blood pressure 118/62, and SpO2 98%. The pain level is reported as 6/10. The patient is alert and oriented, and her vital signs are within normal limits, except for a slightly elevated heart rate, which could be due to pain or dehydration from vomiting. She does not require immediate life-saving intervention, so she is not ESI level 1. She is not in a high-risk situation that would make her ESI level 2, as she is stable and does not have any signs of severe distress or altered mental status. The patient will likely require more than one resource, such as IV fluids for dehydration, antiemetics for vomiting, and possibly pain management, which places her at ESI level 3. ESI level 4 and 5 are not appropriate as they are for patients requiring one or no resources, respectively.","“My migraine started early this morning, and I can’t get it under control. I just keep vomiting. Can I lie down somewhere?” asks a 37-year-old female. Past medical history migraines, no allergies. Pain 6/10, T 98˚F, RR 20, HR 102, BP 118/62, SpO2 98%.","ESI level 3: Two  or  more  resources.  A patient with a known history of migraines with vomiting will require pain medication, an antiemetic, and fluid replacement. The pain is not severe, 6/10. This patient is not high risk.",3
,1,"The patient is a 26-year-old female who has been exposed to smoke inhalation from a burning building. She is experiencing respiratory distress, as evidenced by her hoarseness, sore throat, cough, and notably increased respiratory rate of 40 breaths per minute. Her heart rate is elevated at 114 beats per minute, which may be a response to hypoxia or stress. She has a history of asthma, which could exacerbate her current respiratory condition. The patient's blood pressure is within normal limits, but the primary concern is her respiratory status. Given her increased work of breathing and the potential for airway compromise due to smoke inhalation, she requires immediate medical evaluation and intervention to secure her airway and manage her respiratory distress. This situation is potentially life-threatening and requires immediate attention.","""The smoke was so bad; I just couldn’t breathe.” reports a 26-year-old female who entered her burning apartment building to try to rescue her cat. She is hoarse and complaining of a sore throat and a cough. You notice that she is working hard at breathing. History of asthma; uses inhalers when needed. No known drug allergies. Vital signs: T 98˚F, RR 40, HR 114, BP 108/74. ","ESI  level  1:  Requires   immediate lifesaving intervention. From the  history and presentation, this patient appears to have a significant airway injury and will require immediate intubation. Her respiratory rate is 40, and she is in respiratory distress.",1
,3,"The patient is a 27-year-old female who is 7 weeks pregnant and experiencing persistent vomiting, leading to concerns about dehydration. Her vital signs show a slightly elevated heart rate (HR 104), which could be indicative of dehydration. Her blood pressure is on the lower side (104/68), but not critically low. The temperature is normal, and her oxygen saturation is also normal. She reports no pain, but her lips are dry and cracked, which supports the suspicion of dehydration. The patient is not in immediate danger and does not require life-saving intervention, ruling out ESI level 1. She is stable and does not have a high-risk situation that would require immediate attention, ruling out ESI level 2. However, she will likely need multiple resources, such as IV fluids for rehydration and possibly lab tests to assess her electrolyte levels, which aligns with ESI level 3. ESI levels 4 and 5 are not appropriate as they are for cases requiring fewer resources.","“I’m 7 weeks pregnant, and every time I try to eat something, I throw up,” reports a 27-year- old female. “My doctor sent me to the emergency department because he thinks I am getting dehydrated. T 97˚F, RR 18, HR 104, BP 104/68, SpO2 99%. Pain 0/10. Lips are dry and cracked.","ESI level 3: Two or more resources. Lab studies, IV fluid, and an IV antiemetic are three of the resources this patient will require. She is showing signs of dehydration.",3
,3,"The patient is a 52-year-old female with aching pain in her left leg after a prolonged period of sitting in a car. She denies any other complaints, and her vital signs are within normal limits, except for slightly elevated blood pressure. The clinical presentation suggests a possible deep vein thrombosis (DVT) due to prolonged immobility, which is a risk factor for DVT, especially in an obese patient. However, she is hemodynamically stable, with no signs of respiratory distress or other life-threatening conditions. Therefore, she does not require immediate life-saving intervention (ESI 1) or high-risk interventions (ESI 2). The patient will likely need diagnostic testing, such as an ultrasound, to rule out DVT, which involves more than one resource. Thus, the appropriate ESI level is 3.","“I have this aching pain in my left leg,” reports an obese 52-year-old female. “The whole ride home, it just ached and ached.” The patient  tells you that she has been sitting in a car for the last 2 days. “We drove my daughter to college, and I thought it was the heat getting to me.” She denies any other complaints. Vital signs: BP 148/90, HR 86, RR 16, T 98˚F.","ESI level 3: Two or more resources. At a minimum, she will require labs and noninvasive vascular studies of her lower leg. She should be placed in a wheelchair with her leg elevated and instructed not to walk until the doctor has seen her.",3
,2,"The patient is an 87-year-old male who fell and hit his head. He is awake, alert, and oriented, which indicates that he is currently stable and does not require immediate life-saving intervention, ruling out ESI level 1. His vital signs are within normal limits, suggesting he is not in a high-risk situation that would necessitate ESI level 2. However, he is on warfarin, an anticoagulant, which increases the risk of intracranial bleeding after a head injury. This risk factor makes him a high-risk patient, as complications could arise from the fall due to his anticoagulation therapy. Therefore, he should be prioritized for further evaluation and possibly imaging to rule out any internal bleeding. This situation aligns with ESI level 2, where the patient is high-risk and requires prompt evaluation.","EMS arrives with an 87-year-old male who fell and hit his head. He is awake, alert, and oriented and remembers the fall. He has a past medical history of atrial fibrillation and is on multiple medications, including warfarin.

,5,"The patient is a 27-year-old male presenting with a request for a prescription refill for pain medication due to a back injury sustained at work. He denies any red flag symptoms such as numbness, tingling, or bladder or bowel issues, which suggests there is no immediate threat to life or limb. His vital signs are within normal limits, indicating he is stable. The pain is reported as 10+/10, but this alone does not necessitate immediate life-saving intervention. The patient's condition does not require multiple resources for evaluation or treatment, as he is primarily seeking a prescription refill. Therefore, the situation is non-urgent and requires minimal resources.","“I just need another prescription for pain medication. I was here 10 days ago and ran out,” a 27-year-old male tells you. “I hurt my back at work, and it’s still bothering me.”  Denies numbness, tingling, or bladder or bowel issues.

She has a +2 pedal pulse, warm toes, and can wiggle them, indicating that there is no immediate threat to limb perfusion or function. Her vital signs are within normal limits, and she denies any past medical history, medications, or allergies. Although the open fracture is a serious injury that requires prompt attention, it does not require immediate life-saving intervention, which would classify it as ESI level 1. The patient will need more than one resource, such as imaging, orthopedic consultation, and possibly surgery, which places her above ESI level 4 or 5. Given the nature of the injury and the need for multiple resources, the appropriate ESI level is 3.","EMS arrives with a 32-year-old female who fell off a stepladder while cleaning her first-floor gutters. She has an obvious open fracture of her right lower leg. She has +2 pedal pulse. Her toes are warm, and she is able to wiggle them.  Denies past medical history medications, or allergies.

,3,"The patient is a 27-year-old female with low abdominal pain and spotting, with a history of ectopic pregnancy. Her vital signs are stable, and she does not exhibit signs of hemodynamic instability or require immediate life-saving intervention, ruling out ESI level 1. The presence of abdominal pain and spotting, combined with a history of ectopic pregnancy, raises concern for a potential ectopic pregnancy, which could become life-threatening if not addressed. This situation requires prompt evaluation and possible intervention, suggesting a higher acuity level. However, she is currently stable and does not require immediate resuscitation, ruling out ESI level 2. The patient will likely need diagnostic resources such as an ultrasound and possibly laboratory tests to evaluate her condition, which aligns with ESI level 3, as she is stable but requires multiple resources for diagnosis and management.","A 27-year-old female wants to be checked by a doctor.

She has a history of a previous stroke and is on aspirin, which increases her risk for another cerebrovascular event. While she is currently stable, the recent episode of neurological symptoms requires prompt evaluation to prevent a potential stroke. This situation does not require immediate life-saving intervention (ESI 1), but it does necessitate a high level of urgency due to the risk of a stroke. The patient will likely need multiple resources, such as imaging (CT or MRI), lab tests, and possibly a neurology consult. Therefore, the appropriate ESI level is 2, as she is at high risk for deterioration.","An 88-year-old female is brought to the ED by EMS. This morning, she had an episode of slurred speech and weakness of  her  left  arm that lasted about 45 minutes. She has a history  of a previous stroke, and she takes an aspirin every day. She is alert and oriented with clear speech and equal hand grasps.","ESI level 2: High-risk situation. The patient’s history indicates that she may have had a transient ischemic attack this morning. The patient is high risk, and it would not be safe for her to sit in the waiting room for an extended period of time.",2
,3,"The patient is a 26-year-old pregnant female experiencing vaginal bleeding and crampy pain, which she rates as 1 out of 10. Her vital signs are stable: blood pressure is 110/80, heart rate is 72, respiratory rate is 18, oxygen saturation is 99%, and temperature is 98.6°F. She is concerned about the bleeding during her first pregnancy. According to the ESI, we first assess if the patient requires immediate life-saving intervention, which she does not, as her vital signs are stable and she is not in distress. Next, we consider if the patient is in a high-risk situation. Vaginal bleeding during pregnancy can be concerning, but given the stable vital signs and low pain level, she does not appear to be in immediate danger. The situation does not require many resources, such as multiple diagnostic tests or procedures, and she is not in severe pain or distress. Therefore, she does not meet the criteria for ESI levels 1 or 2. The situation is more urgent than a non-urgent visit, as it involves pregnancy and bleeding, which requires evaluation. However, it is not life-threatening or resource-intensive, suggesting an ESI level of 3.","“It is like I have my period. I went to the bathroom, and I am bleeding. This is my first pregnancy, and I am scared. Do you think everything is OK?” asks a 26-year-old healthy female. Vital signs: BP 110/80, HR 72, RR 18, SpO2 99%, T 98.6˚F. She describes the pain as crampy, but rates it as “1” out of 10.","ESI level 3: Two or more  resources.  Based on her history, this patient will require two or more resources – labs, an ultrasound. On the differential diagnosis list is a spontaneous abortion. Currently, she is hemodynamically stable and has minimal cramping or pain.",3
,1,"The patient is a 34-year-old who is 10 days postpartum and reports sudden heavy bleeding with clots the size of oranges. She appears pale and requests to lie down before she passes out, indicating potential hemodynamic instability. Her vital signs show hypotension (BP 86/40) and tachycardia (HR 132), which are signs of significant blood loss and possible shock. The respiratory rate is slightly elevated at 22, and SpO2 is normal at 98%. The combination of heavy bleeding, hypotension, tachycardia, and the patient's subjective feeling of potentially passing out suggests a critical condition that requires immediate intervention to prevent further deterioration. This clinical presentation aligns with ESI level 1, which is for patients requiring immediate life-saving intervention.","“I suddenly started bleeding and passing clots the size of oranges,” reports a pale 34-year-old who is 10 days post partum. “I never did this with my other two pregnancies. Can I lie down before I pass out?” Vital signs: BP 86/40, HR 132, RR 22, SpO2 98%.","ESI  level  1:  Requires   immediate lifesaving intervention. This patient is presenting with signs and symptoms of a post partum hemorrhage. She tells you she is going to pass out, and her vital signs reflect her fluid volume deficit. The patient needs immediate IV access and aggressive fluid resuscitation.",1
,4,"The patient is a 39-year-old female with a history of asthma who presents with wheezing after having a cold for a few days. Her vital signs are within normal limits: temperature is 98˚F, respiratory rate is 22, heart rate is 88, blood pressure is 130/80, and oxygen saturation is 99%. She is not on any medications and has no allergies. The patient is requesting a breathing treatment, which suggests she is experiencing an exacerbation of her asthma. However, her oxygen saturation is normal, and there are no signs of respiratory distress or need for immediate life-saving intervention. Therefore, she does not meet the criteria for ESI level 1. The patient is stable and does not require multiple resources, as a single breathing treatment is likely sufficient. This places her in ESI level 4, as she requires one resource (the breathing treatment) but is otherwise stable.","I have had a cold for a few days, and today I started wheezing. When this happens, I just need one of those breathing  treatments,” reports a 39-year-old female with a history of asthma. T 98˚F, RR 22, HR 88, BP 130/80, SpO2 99%, No meds, no allergies.",ESI level 4: One resource. This patient will need a hand-held nebulizer treatment for her wheezing. No labs or x ray should be necessary because the patient does not have a fever.,4
,1,"The patient is a 58-year-old male who experienced a cardiac arrest while shoveling snow, which suggests a possible cardiac event exacerbated by cold exposure. Bystander CPR was initiated immediately, and the patient was defibrillated once by paramedics, resulting in the return of a perfusing rhythm. The initiation of the hypothermic cardiac arrest protocol and the administration of cold normal saline indicate that the patient is in a post-cardiac arrest state and is being actively managed for potential therapeutic hypothermia. This clinical scenario involves a life-threatening condition that requires immediate and continuous monitoring and intervention to ensure the patient's stability and to prevent further deterioration. Therefore, the patient requires immediate life-saving intervention and continuous monitoring, which aligns with an ESI level 1.","A 58-year-old male collapsed while shoveling snow. Bystander CPR was started immediately; he was defibrillated once by the paramedics with the return of a perfusing rhythm. The hypothermic cardiac arrest protocol was initiated prehospital, and he presents with cold normal saline infusing.","ESI  level  1:  Requires   immediate lifesaving intervention. Studies have shown that lowering brain temperature post cardiac arrest decreases ischemic damage.

,3,"The patient is a 33-year-old female who had a gastric bypass 3 weeks ago and is now experiencing vomiting and abdominal pain. Her vital signs are within normal limits: blood pressure is 126/70, heart rate is 76, respiratory rate is 14, and temperature is 98°F. The patient's pain is rated as 6/10. Given the recent gastric bypass surgery, there is a concern for potential complications such as an anastomotic leak, obstruction, or other post-surgical issues. However, the patient's vital signs are stable, and there is no indication of immediate life-threatening conditions that would require immediate life-saving intervention (ESI 1). The patient will likely require diagnostic tests such as imaging or labs to determine the cause of her symptoms, which suggests the need for more than one resource. The stability of her vital signs and the absence of severe distress or altered mental status suggest that she does not meet the criteria for ESI 2. Therefore, the most appropriate ESI level is 3, as the patient is stable but requires multiple resources for diagnosis and management.","“My doctor told me to come to the ED. I had a gastric bypass 3 weeks ago and have been doing fine, but today I started vomiting and having this belly pain.” The patient, an obese 33-year- old female, rates her pain as 6/10.

,2,"The patient is a 23-year-old female who is 5 weeks postpartum and presents with symptoms of exhaustion, shortness of breath upon exertion, and swollen ankles. These symptoms could indicate a potential cardiac issue, such as postpartum cardiomyopathy, which can be serious. Although she has been evaluated for anemia and it was ruled out, the combination of shortness of breath and peripheral edema (swollen ankles) is concerning for possible heart failure or another cardiovascular condition. While she is not in immediate life-threatening distress (e.g., she is not in respiratory failure or showing signs of shock), her symptoms warrant prompt evaluation to rule out serious conditions. Therefore, she requires more than one resource for evaluation, such as lab tests, imaging, and possibly a cardiology consult.","“I had a baby 5 weeks ago, and I am just exhausted. I have seen my doctor twice, and he told  me I wasn’t anemic.  I climb  the stairs,  and  I am so short of breath when I  get  to  the  top that I have to sit down, and now my ankles are swollen.  What  do  you  think  is  wrong  with me?” asks a 23-year-old obese female.","ESI level 2: High risk. This patient is describing more than just the fatigue or anemia. This patient could be describing the classic symptoms of a low-volume but high-risk situation – peripartum cardiomyopathy, a form of cardiomyopathy that occurs in the last month of pregnancy and up to 5 months post- partum.

,5,"The patient is a 76-year-old male who is requesting medical attention for hard toenails, which he is unable to cut himself. There are no signs of infection or breaks in the skin, and his vital signs are normal for his age. The patient's history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is noted, but it does not appear to be contributing to an acute issue at this time. The primary concern is the inability to manage toenail care, which is a non-urgent issue. The patient does not require immediate life-saving intervention, and the situation does not involve high-risk criteria or require multiple resources. Therefore, the acuity level is low.","76-year-old male requests to see a doctor because his toenails are hard.

He reports no pain and has no past medical history. The symptoms suggest a possible case of benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) or another non-life-threatening vestibular issue. The patient is stable, does not require immediate life-saving intervention, and his condition does not appear to be high risk. He will likely need some diagnostic evaluation and possibly medication to manage symptoms, but these do not constitute a high resource need.

Although the patient is currently stable with normal vital signs (T 98.5˚F, RR 20, HR 90, BP 120/80), the shock suggests a serious underlying cardiac issue that requires immediate evaluation. The patient's significant cardiac history and recent medication changes, including the use of amiodarone, further increase the risk of a serious cardiac event. While the patient is not in immediate distress or requiring life-saving intervention at this moment, the potential for a serious condition necessitates prompt assessment and monitoring. Therefore, the patient should be prioritized for rapid evaluation.","“My wife called 911 because my internal defibrillator gave me a shock this morning when I was eating breakfast. Really scared me!

While she is in significant distress, she is able to communicate, and her vital signs do not indicate immediate life-threatening instability. She does not require immediate life-saving intervention, which rules out ESI level 1. However, her age, severe pain, and potential for a serious underlying condition (e.g., bowel obstruction, ischemia) suggest she needs prompt evaluation and multiple resources, such as imaging and laboratory tests, to determine the cause of her symptoms. Therefore, she is best categorized as ESI level 2, as she is high risk and needs to be seen quickly.","An 82-year-old resident of a local assisted living facility called 911 because of excruciating generalized abdominal pain and vomiting that started a few hours ago.

She also has a fever (T 100.8˚F) and reports dysuria, suggesting a possible urinary tract infection that could be leading to sepsis, especially given her age and altered mental status. Her vital signs show a slightly elevated heart rate (HR 98) and respiratory rate (RR 22), which could indicate a systemic response to infection. The fact that she is disoriented and responds only to verbal stimuli suggests a significant alteration in her level of consciousness. According to ESI guidelines, any patient with an acute change in mental status is considered high acuity. While she does not require immediate life-saving intervention (ESI 1), her condition is serious and requires prompt evaluation and treatment, likely involving multiple resources.

His skin is cool and clammy.","ESI  level  1:   Requires   immediate lifesaving intervention. This patient is experiencing another cardiac event that requires immediate treatment. His vital signs and skin perfusion are suggestive of cardiogenic shock, and the patient may require fluid resuscitation or vasopressors to treat hypotension.",1
,3,"The patient is a 64-year-old male presenting with a red, swollen, and tender knee 3 months post knee replacement. His vital signs are relatively stable: temperature is slightly elevated at 99°F, respiratory rate is 20, heart rate is 74, blood pressure is 164/74, and oxygen saturation is 97%. The patient reports a pain level of 6/10. The presentation suggests a possible infection or inflammation of the knee joint, which requires medical evaluation and likely intervention, such as imaging and possibly antibiotics. However, the patient is not in immediate danger and does not require life-saving intervention. The situation is urgent but not critical, and the patient will likely need more than one resource for diagnosis and treatment, such as laboratory tests and imaging. Therefore, the appropriate ESI level is 3.","“I had a knee replacement 3 months ago. Now look at it!” states a 64-year-old male. The knee is red, swollen and tender to touch. Vital signs: T 99°F, RR 20, HR 74, BP 164/74, SpO2 97%. Pain 6/10.","ESI level 3: Two or more resources. The patient is presenting with signs and symptoms of an infection. At a minimum, he will require labs, an x ray, an orthopedic consult, and IV antibiotics.",3
,3,"The patient is a 67-year-old female with a fever and cough for 3 days, producing thick green phlegm, which raises the suspicion of pneumonia. Her vital signs show a temperature of 102°F, respiratory rate of 28, heart rate of 86, blood pressure of 140/72, and oxygen saturation of 94%. She denies shortness of breath. The elevated respiratory rate and fever indicate a moderate level of distress, but she is not in immediate life-threatening condition. Her oxygen saturation is slightly low, but not critically so. She will likely require diagnostic tests such as a chest X-ray and possibly blood work to confirm pneumonia and determine the appropriate treatment. She does not require immediate life-saving intervention (ESI 1) and is not in a high-risk situation that would necessitate immediate attention (ESI 2). However, she will need more than one resource for diagnosis and treatment, which places her at ESI 3.","EMS arrives with a 67-year-old female who lives alone. The patient called 911 because she was too sick to get herself to the doctor. The patient has had a fever and cough for 3 days. She reports coughing up thick green phlegm and is concerned that she has pneumonia. She denies shortness of breath. Past medical history HTN, T 102°F, RR 28, HR 86, BP 140/72, SpO2 94%.","ESI level 3: Two or more resources. This elderly patient may have pneumonia. Labs and a chest x ray are required, in addition to IV antibiotics. If vital signs are outside the accepted parameters, they may be considered high risk and meet ESI level-2 criteria.",3
,5,"The patient is presenting with anxiety due to a potential rabies exposure from a bat in her bedroom. There are no immediate life-threatening conditions or symptoms that require life-saving intervention, so ESI level 1 is not appropriate. The patient's vital signs are within normal limits, and there is no indication of a high-risk situation that would require immediate attention, ruling out ESI level 2. The primary concern is the potential need for rabies prophylaxis, which is a preventive measure rather than an urgent medical treatment. This situation does not require multiple resources, as the main intervention would be a consultation and possibly a rabies vaccine, which is a single resource. Therefore, the situation is non-urgent, and the patient can be classified as ESI level 5.","“I woke up this morning, and there was a bat flying around our bedroom. Scared me half to death, and now I am so worried about rabies,”  an anxious 48-year-old female tells you. “My husband opened the window, and the bat flew out.” Past medical history of ovarian cysts, no med or allergies, vital signs are within normal limits.","ESI level 4: One resource. It is unknown whether the patient was bitten by the bat because they were sleeping, so postexposure prophylaxis will be initiated. One resource—an intramuscular medication.",4
,1,"The patient is a 74-year-old male presenting with severe mid-abdominal pain, which is significant given his wife's statement that he is not a complainer. His vital signs are concerning: heart rate (HR) is 140, indicating tachycardia; respiratory rate (RR) is 28, indicating tachypnea; SpO2 is 94%, which is slightly low; and blood pressure (BP) is 72/56, indicating hypotension. These signs suggest hemodynamic instability, possibly due to a serious condition such as a ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm or another form of shock. The hypotension and tachycardia suggest that the patient is in a state of shock and requires immediate intervention to stabilize his condition. According to the ESI criteria, a patient with such vital signs and potential for life-threatening conditions requires immediate life-saving intervention, classifying him as ESI level 1.","The family of a 74-year-old male called 911 when he developed severe mid-abdominal pain. “My husband is not a complainer,” reports his wife. “The only medication he takes is for high blood pressure.” On arrival in the ED, the patient’s HR is 140, RR 28, SpO2 94%, BP 72/56.","ESI level 1: The patient is presenting with signs of shock, hypotension tachycardia, and tachypnea. He has a history of HTN and is presenting with signs and symptoms that could be suggestive of a dissecting aortic abdominal aneurysm. On arrival in the emergency department, he will require immediate lifesaving interventions such as immediate IV access, aggressive fluid resuscitation, and perhaps blood prior to surgery.",1
,5,"The patient is a 29-year-old with red and crusty eyes, likely indicating conjunctivitis, a common and non-urgent condition. She denies pain or visual disturbances, and her vital signs are normal, suggesting no immediate threat to life or limb. The condition is not life-threatening, does not require immediate intervention, and is unlikely to require multiple resources. Therefore, this presentation is consistent with a low-acuity level.","“I woke up this morning, and my eyes are all  red and crusty,” reports a 29-year-old kindergarten teacher. “I think I got it from the kids at school,” she tells you. She denies pain or other visual disturbances. Her vital signs are within normal limits.","ESI level 5: No resources. Following a physical exam, this patient will be discharged to home with a prescription and appropriate discharge instructions. No resources are required.",5
,5,"The patient is a 19-year-old healthy male presenting with a skin rash in the groin area, which he suspects is jock rot. He has no abnormal vital signs, indicating he is stable. The condition described is not life-threatening and does not require immediate intervention. The patient is likely to need minimal resources, such as a physical examination and possibly a prescription for antifungal medication. There is no indication of severe pain, distress, or any other symptoms that would necessitate a higher acuity level.","“I have this skin rash in my crotch. It looks like jock rot. Probably got it from not washing my gym clothes,” reports a 19-year-old healthy male. No abnormal vital signs.","ESI level 5: No resources. Following a physical exam, this young man will be discharged to home with a prescription and appropriate discharge instructions.",5
,5,"The patient is a 54-year-old diabetic male who is returning for a follow-up on a previously lanced boil. He reports feeling much better, indicating that there are no immediate life-threatening conditions. His vital signs are stable: temperature is normal at 98°F, respiratory rate is normal at 16 breaths per minute, heart rate is normal at 64 beats per minute, blood pressure is within normal limits at 142/78 mmHg, and oxygen saturation is normal at 98%. The patient reports mild pain at 2/10. There is no indication of a need for immediate life-saving intervention (ESI 1), high-risk situation (ESI 2), or multiple resources (ESI 3). The follow-up visit for wound check and the stable condition suggest minimal resources are needed, aligning with ESI 4 or 5. Given the context of a follow-up visit and stable condition, ESI 5 is appropriate as the patient is likely to require minimal resources.","“The doctor told me to come back this morning and have my boil checked. He lanced it yesterday and packed some stuff in it. He said he just want to make sure it is healing OK,” reports a 54-year-old diabetic male. The patient goes on to tell you that he feels so much better. T 98°F, RR 16, HR 64, BP 142/78, SpO2 98%. Pain 2/10.","ESI level 5: No resources. This patient was instructed to come back to the emergency department for a wound check. He will be examined and discharged to home. No resources are required. A point-of-care finger stick glucose is indicated, but this is not a resource. If the patient came back with a fever or increasing pain and redness, then his ESI level would reflect the additional resources he would require.",5
,3,"The patient is a 43-year-old female with a history of asthma, presenting with wheezing, fever, and ineffective relief from a rescue inhaler. Her vital signs show a fever (T 101.4°F), tachypnea (RR 26), normal heart rate (HR 90), normal blood pressure (BP 138/70), and slightly reduced oxygen saturation (SpO2 95%). The patient's respiratory rate and history of asthma suggest a potential exacerbation that requires medical evaluation. However, she is not in immediate life-threatening distress as her SpO2 is still within an acceptable range and she is not showing signs of severe respiratory compromise (e.g., SpO2 < 90%, altered mental status). She will likely require more than one resource, such as nebulizer treatments, possible steroids, and further diagnostic evaluation. Therefore, she does not meet the criteria for ESI level 1 or 2, but her condition is more urgent than a level 4 or 5.","“I have been wheezing for a few days, and  today I woke up with a fever. My rescue inhaler doesn’t seem to be helping,” reports a 43-year- old female with a past history of asthma. Vital signs: T 101.4°F, RR 26, HR 90, BP 138/70, SpO2 95%.","ESI level 3: Two or more resources. This patient has a history of asthma that is not responding to her rescue inhaler. In addition, she has a fever. At a minimum, she will need two resources: hand-held nebulizer treatments and a chest x ray.",3
,2,"The patient is a 56-year-old male with a sudden, transient loss of vision in one eye, lasting about 5 minutes. This symptom could indicate a transient ischemic attack (TIA) or other serious neurological or vascular event. The patient's history of hypertension and high cholesterol increases the risk for such events. While the symptom has resolved, the potential for a serious underlying condition requires prompt evaluation. The patient is stable and does not require immediate life-saving intervention, ruling out ESI level 1. However, the need for urgent evaluation to prevent possible stroke or other complications suggests an ESI level of 2, as the patient is at high risk.","“I was having breakfast with my wife, and all of a sudden I couldn’t see out of my right eye. It lasted about 5 minutes. I’m just scared because I’ve never had anything like this happen  before,” reports a 56-year-old male with a history of HTN and high cholesterol.","ESI level 2: High risk. This patient is exhibiting signs of central retinal artery occlusion, which represents an acute threat to loss of vision. Rapid evaluation is necessary.",2
,4,"The patient is a 43-year-old female who twisted her ankle. Her vital signs are stable: temperature is 98°F, heart rate is 72, respiratory rate is 18, blood pressure is 134/80, and SpO2 is 100%. She reports significant pain at 8/10. There is no indication of a life-threatening condition or need for immediate life-saving intervention, ruling out ESI level 1. The patient is stable and does not require high resource intensity or multiple resources, which rules out ESI levels 2 and 3. The primary concern is pain management and possibly an X-ray to rule out a fracture, which suggests the need for one or two resources. This aligns with ESI level 4, as the patient will likely need an X-ray and pain medication.","“I was walking down the street and twisted my ankle as I stepped off the curb. I don’t think it’s broken, but it hurts so much,” report a 43-year- old female with a history of colitis. Vital signs:  T 98°F, HR 72, RR 18, BP 134/80, SpO2 100%. Pain 8/10.","ESI level 4: One resource. To rule out a fracture, this patient will require an x ray, one resource. The application of a splint and crutch walking instructions are not counted as resources. This patient does not meet the criteria for ESI level 2 for pain because nursing can immediately initiate interventions to address her pain.",4
,3,"The patient is a 26-year-old female with a history of colitis, presenting with increased stool frequency and cramping. Her vital signs are stable: temperature is 97°F, respiratory rate is 18, heart rate is 68, blood pressure is 112/76, and oxygen saturation is 100%. She reports a pain level of 6/10. There is no indication of a life-threatening condition or need for immediate life-saving intervention, which rules out ESI level 1. The patient is stable and does not appear to be in severe distress, so ESI level 2 is not appropriate. The patient will likely require more than one resource for evaluation and management, such as laboratory tests or imaging, which suggests an ESI level of 3. ESI levels 4 and 5 are not appropriate as they are for cases requiring one or no resources, respectively.","“My colitis is acting up,” report a 26-year-old female. “It started with an increased number of stools, and now I am cramping a lot. My gastroenterologist told me to come to the emergency department to be evaluated.” No other past medical history. T 97°F, RR 18, HR 68, BP 112/76, SpO2 100%. Pain 6/10.","ESI level 3: Two or more resources.  The patient is presenting with a colitis flare. She will need labs and possibly an IV and a CT of the abdomen, especially in light of her presentation with normal vital signs. Two resources.",3
,3,"The patient is a 46-year-old female with a known history of sickle cell disease presenting with a pain crisis. Her pain is severe, rated at 8/10, and her current pain medication is ineffective. Despite the high pain level, her vital signs are stable, and there are no immediate life-threatening conditions present. According to the ESI guidelines, patients with severe pain due to a known condition like sickle cell crisis, who are hemodynamically stable, typically fall under ESI level 3. This is because they require multiple resources for pain management and possibly further evaluation or treatment, but they do not require immediate life-saving intervention.","A 46-year-old female with a history of sickle cell disease presents to the emergency department because of a crisis. She has pain in her lower legs that began 8 hours ago, and the pain medication she is taking is not working. Currently, she rates her pain as 8/10. She has no other medical problems, and her current medications include folate and vicodin. Vital signs are all within normal limits.","ESI level 2: High risk. Sickle cell disease requires immediate medical attention because of the severity of the patient’s pain, which is caused by the sickle cells occluding small and sometimes large blood vessels. Rapid analgesic management will help prevent the crisis from progressing to the point where hospitalization will be unavoidable.",2
,3,"The patient is a 54-year-old male on blood thinners with a history of clots in his legs, now presenting with pain and swelling in the lower leg. This presentation is concerning for a possible deep vein thrombosis (DVT), especially given his history and current symptoms. However, his vital signs are within normal limits, and he denies any other complaints, indicating that he is currently stable. The situation does not require immediate life-saving intervention (ESI 1), and he is not in a high-risk situation that would require immediate attention (ESI 2). The patient will likely need diagnostic testing, such as an ultrasound, to confirm the presence of a DVT, which involves more than one resource. Therefore, the appropriate ESI level is 3.","“I take a blood thinner because I have had clots in my legs,” reports a 54-year-old black male. “They told me that medicine would prevent them, but today I have pain and swelling in my lower leg. It started out just being sore, but now I can hardly walk on it.” Denies any other complaints. Vital signs within normal limits.",ESI level 3: Two or more resources. This patient will need lab tests and lower-extremity vascular studies to rule out a deep vein thrombosis.,3
,3,"The patient is a 65-year-old female who requires a PEG tube replacement. She is stable with vital signs within normal limits and has no acute changes in her condition. She is aphasic due to a past stroke, but this is her baseline condition. The fact that she is a DNR/DNI does not affect the acuity level unless she were in a life-threatening situation, which she is not. The procedure of replacing a PEG tube is routine and does not require immediate life-saving intervention. The patient will require one or more resources for the procedure, but there is no indication of high-risk criteria or need for immediate intervention. Therefore, she does not meet the criteria for ESI levels 1 or 2. Given that she will need a procedure (PEG tube replacement), she will require more than one resource, which aligns with ESI level 3.","A 65-year-old female is brought in by ambulance from the local nursing home for replacement of her PEG tube. The information from the nursing home states that she had a massive stroke 3 years ago and is now aphasic. Her condition is unchanged, and she is a do not resuscitate/do not intubate. Vital signs within normal limits.",ESI level 3: Two or more resources. This patient will need to be seen by surgery or GI and her PEG tube reinserted—two resources.,3
,2,"The patient is a 26-year-old female presenting with mental health concerns, specifically related to increased stress and potential self-harm ideation. She has a history of previous suicide attempts, which increases her risk. Although she admits to thinking about hurting herself, she currently has no plan, which suggests that immediate life-saving intervention is not required. Her vital signs are within normal limits, indicating no immediate physiological distress. However, due to the potential risk of self-harm and her mental health history, she requires urgent mental health evaluation and intervention. This situation does not require immediate life-saving intervention (ESI 1), but it is more urgent than a non-urgent case (ESI 5). The need for a mental health evaluation and the potential risk of self-harm elevate her acuity level to ESI 2, as she is a high-risk situation that requires timely intervention.","26-year-old female presents to the ED because she can’t get an appointment  with  her therapist. She went home for the holidays, and the visit brought back many issues from her childhood. She is unable to sleep and has been drinking more than usual. She admits to thinking about hurting herself but has no plan. History of previous suicide attempts. Vital signs within normal limits.",ESI level 2: High-risk situation.  This patient is a danger to herself and needs to be placed in a safe environment with a constant observer.,2

These vital signs indicate that he is currently stable, with slightly elevated blood pressure but no immediate life-threatening conditions. He does not require immediate life-saving intervention, and his condition is not high-risk. The patient is likely to need only a prescription refill, which is a single resource. Therefore, based on the ESI criteria, this situation is non-urgent and requires minimal resources.","“I am here on business for a week, and I forgot to pack my blood pressure  medication.  I haven’t taken it for 2 days. Do you think one of the doctors will write me a prescription?” asks a 58-year-old male. BP 154/88, HR 64, RR 18, T 98°F, SpO2 99%.",ESI level 5: No resources. The patient  will need a history and physical exam and then will be discharged to home with a prescription. An oral dose of his blood pressure medication does not count as a resource.,5
,5,"The patient is a 42-year-old female who fell while running for the bus. She reports no pain and only has road burn on both knees. Her vital signs are within normal limits, indicating no immediate threat to life or limb. She is requesting a tetanus booster, which is a preventive measure rather than a treatment for an acute condition. The patient's condition is stable, and she does not require any immediate life-saving intervention. The resources needed are minimal, likely just a tetanus booster and possibly some wound cleaning. Based on these factors, the patient does not meet the criteria for ESI levels 1, 2, or 3, which involve more urgent or resource-intensive care. Therefore, the appropriate ESI level is 5, indicating a non-urgent condition requiring minimal resources.","“I fell running for the bus,” reports a 42-year- old female. “Nothing hurts, I just have road burn on both my knees, and I think I need a tetanus booster.” Vital signs within normal limits.","ESI level 5: No resources. A tetanus booster is not a resource, and neither is cleaning and dressing abrasions.",5
,1,"The patient is a 21-year-old with a single gunshot wound to the left chest, which is a potentially life-threatening injury. The vital signs indicate hemodynamic instability: a blood pressure of 78/palp suggests hypotension, a heart rate of 148 indicates tachycardia, and a respiratory rate of 36 suggests respiratory distress. Although the SpO2 is 96% on a non-rebreather, the need for high-flow oxygen and the presence of a gunshot wound to the chest suggest the potential for rapid deterioration. The patient requires immediate life-saving intervention, such as airway management, fluid resuscitation, and possibly surgical intervention. Therefore, the patient meets the criteria for ESI level 1, which is assigned to patients requiring immediate life-saving interventions.","EMS radios in that they are in route with a 21- year-old with a single gunshot wound to the left chest. Vital signs are BP 78/palp, HR 148, RR 36, SpO2 96% on a non-rebreather.","ESI  level  1:  Requires  immediate lifesaving intervention.

,3,"The patient is a 51-year-old male presenting with redness and swelling of the right hand after a cat scratch, which suggests a possible infection. His vital signs show a fever (T 101.8°F) and tachycardia (HR 118), indicating a systemic response to the infection. However, his blood pressure, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation are within normal limits, and he is not in severe pain (5/10). The patient does not require immediate life-saving intervention (ESI 1) and is not in a high-risk situation that would require immediate attention (ESI 2). The patient will likely need more than one resource, such as laboratory tests and possibly antibiotics, which places him in ESI 3. ESI 4 and 5 are not appropriate as the patient is not stable enough to be considered non-urgent.","A 51-year-old presents to triage with redness  and swelling of his right hand.

,2,"The patient is a 52-year-old female who has overdosed on Wellbutrin, taking eight 75 mg tablets, which totals 600 mg. This overdose occurred 2 hours ago. Despite the overdose, the patient is currently awake, alert, and oriented, indicating that she is not in immediate life-threatening distress. However, the situation is serious due to the potential for delayed effects of the overdose, such as seizures or cardiac issues, which are known risks with Wellbutrin overdose. Additionally, the overdose was intentional, indicating a psychiatric emergency. While the patient does not require immediate life-saving intervention at this moment, she does require urgent evaluation and monitoring for potential complications from the overdose and psychiatric assessment. Therefore, she does not meet the criteria for ESI level 1, which requires immediate life-saving intervention. However, due to the potential for serious complications and the need for multiple resources, including medical and psychiatric evaluation, the patient is best categorized as ESI level 2.","EMS arrives with a 52-year-old female overdose. The patient took eight 75 mg tabs of wellbutrin 2 hours ago because her husband left her for another woman, and now she wants to die. She is awake, alert, and oriented.","ESI level 2:  High-risk  situation.

This patient is suicidal and also needs to be monitored closely for safety.",2
,3,"The patient is a 48-year-old male with a history of heavy alcohol use, presenting with restlessness and tremors after being without alcohol since the previous evening. His vital signs show hypertension (BP 172/124) and tachycardia (HR 122), which are concerning but not immediately life-threatening. The patient is likely experiencing alcohol withdrawal, which can progress to more severe symptoms such as seizures or delirium tremens if not treated. However, at this moment, he does not require immediate life-saving intervention, as his airway, breathing, and circulation are stable. He does not meet the criteria for ESI level 1. The patient is not in severe distress or high-risk situation that would require immediate intervention, so he does not meet ESI level 2 criteria. The patient will likely require multiple resources for management, such as IV fluids, medications for withdrawal symptoms, and monitoring, which aligns with ESI level 3. ESI level 4 and 5 are not appropriate as they involve fewer resources and less urgent conditions.","The local police arrive with a 48-year-old male who was arrested last night for public intoxication.
