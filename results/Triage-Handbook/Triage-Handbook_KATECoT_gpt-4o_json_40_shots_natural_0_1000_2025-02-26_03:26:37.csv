This patient needs to be evaluated by the stroke team and have a head CT within minutes of arrival in the ED. Many nurses want to make all stroke alerts an ESI level 1. This patient does not meet level 1 criteria as she does not require immediate lifesaving. interventions. The triage nurse needs to facilitate moving this patient into the treatment area and initiate the stroke alert process,2
,2,"The patient is an 88-year-old female who experienced an episode of slurred speech and weakness in her left arm, which lasted for about 45 minutes. This presentation is suggestive of a transient ischemic attack (TIA), which is a warning sign for a potential stroke. Although her symptoms have resolved, her age and history of a previous stroke increase her risk for a future stroke. Immediate evaluation and intervention are necessary to prevent a full-blown stroke. Comparing this case to similar cases, such as those involving potential strokes or TIAs, the acuity level is typically higher due to the need for urgent assessment and possible intervention. Therefore, based on the potential severity and the need for timely medical evaluation, the appropriate ESI acuity level is 2.","An 88-year-old female is brought to the ED by EMS. This morning, she had an episode of slurred speech and weakness of  her  left  arm that lasted about 45 minutes. She has a history  of a previous stroke, and she takes an aspirin every day. She is alert and oriented with clear speech and equal hand grasps.","ESI level 2: High-risk situation. The patient’s history indicates that she may have had a transient ischemic attack this morning.

,2,"Step 1: Assess the Patient's Risk & Resource Needs - The patient is a 26-year-old pregnant female experiencing vaginal bleeding and crampy pain, which she rates as 1/10. Her vital signs are stable. Vaginal bleeding during pregnancy can be a sign of a potential miscarriage or other complications, which requires further evaluation. Step 2: Analyze and Compare with Similar Patient Cases - In the examples, cases involving potential pregnancy complications, such as the 16-year-old female who took acetaminophen tablets, were assigned an ESI level of 2 due to the potential for serious outcomes. Step 3: Determine the ESI acuity level for this patient based on the examples and your assessment of the patient's clinical presentation - Given the potential seriousness of vaginal bleeding during pregnancy, even with stable vital signs, the patient should be evaluated promptly to rule out any complications. Therefore, the appropriate ESI level is 2.","“It is like I have my period. I went to the bathroom, and I am bleeding. This is my first pregnancy, and I am scared.

Her vital signs are stable, with a normal temperature, respiratory rate, heart rate, blood pressure, and oxygen saturation. She reports needing a breathing treatment, which suggests she may require a nebulizer treatment or similar intervention. Step 2: Analyze and Compare with Similar Patient Cases - In the examples, patients with stable vital signs and specific treatment needs, such as a breathing treatment, are often categorized as ESI level 4. For instance, a patient with a toothache and normal vital signs was assigned an ESI level of 5, while a patient with a superficial laceration requiring minimal intervention was assigned an ESI level of 4. Step 3: Determine the ESI acuity level for this patient based on the examples and your assessment of the patient's clinical presentation - Given the patient's stable condition and the likely need for a single resource (breathing treatment), the appropriate ESI level is 4.","I have had a cold for a few days, and today I started wheezing. When this happens, I just need one of those breathing  treatments,” reports a 39-year-old female with a history of asthma.

,2,"Step 1: Assess the Patient's Risk & Resource Needs - The patient is a 33-year-old female who had a gastric bypass 3 weeks ago and is now experiencing vomiting and abdominal pain. Post-operative complications such as anastomotic leaks or obstructions can be serious. Her vital signs are stable, but the recent surgery and current symptoms suggest a potential complication that requires evaluation. Step 2: Analyze and Compare with Similar Patient Cases - Comparing with other cases, patients with recent surgeries and new symptoms often require a higher acuity level due to the risk of complications. For example, the case of a patient with a swollen hand after a cast was placed was rated as ESI 2 due to the potential for serious complications. Step 3: Determine the ESI acuity level for this patient based on the examples and your assessment of the patient's clinical presentation - Given the recent surgery and the onset of symptoms, this patient requires prompt evaluation to rule out serious complications, thus an ESI level of 2 is appropriate.","“My doctor told me to come to the ED.

,2,"Step 1: Assess the Patient's Risk & Resource Needs - The patient is a 23-year-old female who recently had a baby 5 weeks ago. She reports exhaustion, shortness of breath upon climbing stairs, and swollen ankles. These symptoms could indicate a potential cardiac issue, such as heart failure, especially considering the recent pregnancy and obesity. The symptoms of shortness of breath and swollen ankles are concerning and may require further investigation, including cardiac evaluation and possibly imaging or lab tests. Step 2: Analyze and Compare with Similar Patient Cases - Comparing with other cases, such as the 21-year-old female with a rapid heart rate and low blood pressure who was assigned ESI 1, this patient does not present with immediate life-threatening symptoms but does have symptoms that could indicate a serious underlying condition. The case of the 19-year-old male with shortness of breath and low SpO2 was assigned ESI 2, indicating that respiratory distress or potential cardiac issues warrant a higher acuity level. Step 3: Determine the ESI acuity level for this patient based on the examples and your assessment of the patient's clinical presentation - Given the potential for a serious underlying condition such as heart failure, and the need for diagnostic resources, this patient should be assigned an ESI level of 2.","“I had a baby 5 weeks ago, and I am just exhausted.

Her vital signs show a fever (T 102.2˚F), elevated heart rate (HR 90), normal blood pressure (BP 122/80), and normal oxygen saturation (SpO2 98%). The symptoms suggest that the mastitis may not be responding to the current antibiotic treatment, and there is a risk of developing an abscess or more severe infection. However, she is not in immediate danger, as her vital signs are relatively stable, and she is not showing signs of sepsis or systemic instability. Based on the examples, patients with similar presentations, such as infections not responding to treatment but without immediate life-threatening conditions, are typically assigned an ESI level of 3. This level indicates that the patient requires more than one resource for evaluation and treatment, such as further diagnostic tests and possibly a change in antibiotics.","“I have been on antibiotics for  5  days  for mastitis.  I am continuing to nurse  my baby,  but   I still have pain and tenderness in  my  right breast. Now there is this new reddened area,” a 34-year-old new mother tells you.

This patient probably has been on antibiotics for 5 days for mastitis and now presents to the ED due to fever, chills, and feeling rundown. She will require labs, IV antibiotics, a lactation consult if available, and perhaps admission.",3
,2,"Step 1: Assess the Patient's Risk & Resource Needs - The patient has been shot and presents with two wounds. He is alert and responding appropriately, and his vital signs are stable. However, gunshot wounds can be deceptive, and there is a potential for significant internal injury or bleeding that is not immediately apparent. Step 2: Analyze and Compare with Similar Patient Cases - In the examples, a 17-year-old with a gunshot wound to the chest and unstable vital signs was assigned ESI 1. Another patient with a gunshot wound to the neck and respiratory distress was also ESI 1. However, a patient with a gunshot wound who is alert and has stable vital signs, like this case, would likely be assigned ESI 2, as they require urgent evaluation and potential intervention. Step 3: Determine the ESI acuity level for this patient based on the examples and your assessment of the patient's clinical presentation - Given the potential for serious injury despite stable vital signs, the patient should be prioritized for urgent evaluation and treatment.","A young male walks into triage and tells you that he has been shot. As he rolls up the left leg of his shorts, you notice two wounds. He tells you that he heard three shots. He is alert and responding appropriately to questions. Initial Vital signs: T 98.2˚ F, HR 78, RR 16, BP 118/80.","ESI  level  2:  High-risk   situation.  This patient has two obvious wounds, but until he is thoroughly examined in the trauma room, you can’t rule out the possibility that he has another gunshot wound. The wounds on his thigh look non-life-threatening, but a bullet could have nicked a blood vessel or other structure; therefore, he meets ESI level-2 criteria. His vital signs are within normal limits, so he does not meet ESI level-1 criteria.",2
,2,"Step 1: Assess the Patient's Risk & Resource Needs - The patient is an elderly woman with severe abdominal pain and vomiting, which could indicate a serious underlying condition such as bowel obstruction or ischemia. Her vital signs show tachycardia and tachypnea, which could be signs of distress or pain. She has a history of a heart attack, which adds to her risk profile. Step 2: Analyze and Compare with Similar Patient Cases - Similar cases with severe pain and potential for serious underlying conditions, especially in elderly patients, have been assigned ESI level 2. For example, a 20-year-old male with a dislocated shoulder and severe pain was assigned ESI level 2. Step 3: Determine the ESI acuity level for this patient based on the examples and your assessment of the patient's clinical presentation - Given the patient's severe pain, potential for a serious condition, and her age, she requires prompt evaluation and likely multiple resources, such as imaging and laboratory tests. Therefore, an ESI level of 2 is appropriate.","An 82-year-old resident of a local assisted living facility called 911 because of excruciating generalized abdominal pain and vomiting that started a few hours ago. The woman is moaning in pain but is still  able to tell you that she had  a heart attack 6 years ago. Vital signs: T 98˚F, RR 28, HR 102, BP 146/80, SpO2 98%.

She has vomited twice this morning. Her condition is not life-threatening, and she is not in immediate danger, but she is in significant pain and discomfort. The patient will likely require pain management and possibly antiemetic medication, which indicates the need for more than one resource. Comparing this case to similar cases, such as the 19-year-old with a severe toothache (Acuity Level 5) and the 19-year-old with a belly button infection (Acuity Level 3), this patient requires more immediate attention due to the severity of her pain and the potential need for multiple resources.","“How long am I going to have to wait before I see a doctor?” asks a 27-year-old female with a migraine.

,2,"Step 1: Assess the Patient's Risk & Resource Needs - The patient has a self-inflicted neck laceration, which is a serious injury, but the bleeding is currently controlled. The patient is hemodynamically stable with normal vital signs. However, the nature of the injury and the context (self-inflicted) suggest a potential risk for further self-harm or underlying mental health issues. Step 2: Analyze and Compare with Similar Patient Cases - Comparing with similar cases, such as the 18-year-old female with a suspected medication overdose and the 23-year-old male with a mental health crisis, both were assigned an ESI level of 2 due to the need for urgent mental health evaluation and potential risk of further harm. Step 3: Determine the ESI acuity level for this patient - Given the controlled bleeding and stable vital signs, the immediate physical threat is low, but the self-inflicted nature of the injury and the emotional distress indicate a need for urgent mental health intervention. Therefore, the patient should be assigned an ESI level of 2.","EMS arrives with a 75-year-old male with a self- inflicted 6-centimeter laceration to his neck. Bleeding is currently controlled.

,2,"Step 1: Assess the Patient's Risk & Resource Needs - The patient is a 72-year-old female with altered mental status (disoriented to time and place) and symptoms suggestive of a urinary tract infection (fever and dysuria). Altered mental status in an elderly patient can indicate a serious underlying condition, such as sepsis, especially when combined with fever and potential infection. Step 2: Analyze and Compare with Similar Patient Cases - Cases with altered mental status, especially in the elderly, are often assigned higher acuity levels due to the potential for rapid deterioration. For example, the 2-week-old baby with fever and altered behavior was assigned an ESI level of 2. Step 3: Determine the ESI acuity level for this patient based on the examples and your assessment of the patient's clinical presentation - Given the patient's age, altered mental status, and potential for serious infection, this patient requires prompt evaluation and intervention, likely involving multiple resources such as labs, imaging, and possibly IV antibiotics. Therefore, an ESI level of 2 is appropriate.","“My mother is just not acting herself,” reports the daughter of a 72-year-old female. She is sleeping more than usual and complains that it hurts to pee.” Vital signs: T 100.8˚F, HR 98, RR 22, BP 122/80.

She is currently on antibiotics for a UTI. Her vital signs are within normal range, and there are no other complaints. The primary issue is the dislodged Foley catheter, which is not life-threatening and does not require immediate intervention. Step 2: Analyze and Compare with Similar Patient Cases - Similar cases involve non-urgent issues such as needing a tetanus shot after stepping on a nail or having a foreign object stuck in the rectum, which were assigned ESI levels of 5 and 3, respectively. The current case is more aligned with non-urgent issues as there is no immediate threat to life or limb. Step 3: Determine the ESI acuity level for this patient based on the examples and your assessment of the patient's clinical presentation - The patient requires a Foley catheter replacement, which is a single resource intervention. Given the stable vital signs and lack of immediate risk, the acuity level is determined to be 4.","EMS arrives in the ED with a 57-year-old female with multiple sclerosis.

He used an EpiPen, which is a life-saving intervention for anaphylaxis. Although he currently feels okay and shows stable vital signs, the risk of biphasic anaphylaxis (a second wave of symptoms) necessitates close monitoring and potential further intervention. Step 2: Analyze and Compare with Similar Patient Cases - In the examples, patients with life-threatening conditions or those requiring immediate intervention, such as anaphylaxis, are typically assigned an ESI level of 1. However, since the patient has already used an EpiPen and is currently stable, he may not require immediate life-saving intervention but still needs urgent evaluation and monitoring. Step 3: Determine the ESI acuity level for this patient based on the examples and your assessment of the patient's clinical presentation - Given the potential for a biphasic reaction and the need for monitoring, the patient should be assigned an ESI level of 2, indicating high priority but not requiring immediate life-saving intervention.","A 28-year-old male presents to the ED requesting to be checked.
