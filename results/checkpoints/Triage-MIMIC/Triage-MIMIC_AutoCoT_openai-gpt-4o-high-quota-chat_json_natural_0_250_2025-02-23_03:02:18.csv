Her systolic blood pressure is within normal limits, but her diastolic blood pressure is low. She reports a low pain level of 3 and her chief complaint is 'Wound eval, Transfer'. There is no indication of immediate life-threatening conditions or need for immediate life-saving intervention. The patient's presentation suggests that she will likely require one or more resources for wound evaluation and possible transfer, but her condition does not appear to be urgent or emergent.",17446623,38407485,97.4,70.0,18.0,100.0,113.0,40.0,3,3.0,"Wound eval, Transfer",F,68.0,2017 - 2019,BLACK/AFRICAN AMERICAN,AMBULANCE,False
,2,"The patient is a 69-year-old man who presented with syncope (fainting). His vital signs are mostly within normal limits, except for a slightly low systolic blood pressure of 95 mmHg. Syncope can be a sign of a serious underlying condition, especially in older adults, and warrants further evaluation. However, his current vital signs do not indicate immediate life-threatening instability. Given his age and the potential seriousness of syncope, he will likely require multiple resources for evaluation, such as ECG, blood tests, and possibly imaging.",10210916,30001203,97.0,68.0,18.0,98.0,95.0,78.0,4,2.0,Syncope,M,69.0,2017 - 2019,WHITE,AMBULANCE,False
,3,"The patient is a 56-year-old man presenting with back pain and a need for wound evaluation. His vital signs are relatively stable: temperature is normal, heart rate is slightly bradycardic but not critically low, respiratory rate is normal, oxygen saturation is normal, and blood pressure is slightly elevated but not critically high. The patient reports a high pain level of 10, which indicates severe pain but does not necessarily imply an immediate life-threatening condition. There is no indication of a need for immediate life-saving intervention (ESI 1), and the patient's condition does not appear to be high-risk requiring immediate attention (ESI 2). The patient will likely need more than one resource for evaluation and treatment (e.g., imaging, wound care, pain management), which places him in ESI 3.",11046564,31948464,97.2,58.0,20.0,99.0,152.0,73.0,10,3.0,"Back pain, Wound eval",M,56.0,2017 - 2019,WHITE,AMBULANCE,False
,4,"The patient is a 22-year-old woman with stable vital signs: normal temperature, heart rate, respiratory rate, oxygen saturation, and blood pressure. She reports no pain and has a chief complaint of a wrist laceration. The laceration may require some medical intervention, such as cleaning, suturing, or dressing, but it is not life-threatening and does not require immediate, life-saving intervention. The patient is stable and does not require multiple resources for her care.",11653347,39488773,98.3,71.0,18.0,100.0,130.0,76.0,0,2.0,"R Wrist laceration, Transfer",F,22.0,2017 - 2019,BLACK/AFRICAN AMERICAN,AMBULANCE,False
,4,"The patient is a 22-year-old woman presenting with dysuria. Her vital signs are mostly within normal limits except for a slightly elevated heart rate (110 bpm). She does not require immediate life-saving intervention (ESI 1). She is not in a high-risk situation that would require immediate attention (ESI 2). Her condition does not appear to be severe enough to require multiple resources (ESI 3). Given her stable vital signs and the nature of her complaint, she is likely to need only minimal resources such as a urinalysis and possibly a prescription for antibiotics (ESI 4 or 5). However, considering the elevated heart rate, ESI 4 is more appropriate as it may indicate a need for further evaluation.",18594582,33596282,98.4,110.0,16.0,100.0,122.0,84.0,4,3.0,Dysuria,F,22.0,2017 - 2019,ASIAN - CHINESE,WALK IN,False
,4,"The patient's vital signs are within normal limits except for a slightly elevated heart rate and blood pressure, which are not immediately life-threatening. The chief complaint of dental pain and a lip laceration does not suggest a need for immediate, life-saving intervention. The pain level is reported as '3', which is mild. The patient is stable and does not require multiple resources for immediate care.",17626876,39522204,97.8,96.0,17.0,97.0,149.0,86.0,3,3.0,"Dental pain, Lip laceration",M,24.0,2017 - 2019,WHITE,WALK IN,False
