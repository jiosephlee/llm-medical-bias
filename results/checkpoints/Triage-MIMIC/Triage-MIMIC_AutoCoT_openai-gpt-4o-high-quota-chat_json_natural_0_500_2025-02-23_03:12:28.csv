Her vital signs are within normal limits: temperature 98.8°F, heart rate 88 bpm, respiratory rate 20 breaths/min, oxygen saturation 98%, and blood pressure 142/78 mmHg. She reports no pain. While asthma exacerbation can be serious, her current vitals do not indicate immediate life-threatening instability. She does not require immediate life-saving intervention (ESI 1). However, she will likely need multiple resources such as nebulizer treatments, possible steroids, and monitoring, which places her in ESI 3.",18749373,39164304,98.8,88.0,20.0,98.0,142.0,78.0,0,3.0,"Asthma exacerbation, Dyspnea",F,27.0,2017 - 2019,BLACK/AFRICAN,AMBULANCE,False

Her vital signs are within normal limits: temperature 98.0°F, heart rate 57 bpm, respiratory rate 18 breaths/min, oxygen saturation 100%, and blood pressure 144/61 mmHg. She reports no pain. Numbness can be a symptom of various conditions, some of which may be serious, such as stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA). Given her age and the symptom of numbness, further evaluation is necessary to rule out serious conditions.

His vital signs are within normal limits: temperature 98.5°F, heart rate 60 bpm, respiratory rate 16 breaths/min, oxygen saturation 100%, and blood pressure 126/58 mmHg. Although he reports a pain level of 7, his vital signs do not indicate any immediate life-threatening condition. RLQ abdominal pain could be indicative of conditions such as appendicitis, which requires timely evaluation but not immediate life-saving intervention.
