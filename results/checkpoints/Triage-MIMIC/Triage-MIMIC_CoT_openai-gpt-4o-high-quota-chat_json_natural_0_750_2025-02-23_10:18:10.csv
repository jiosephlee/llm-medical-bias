"{'system': 'You are an expert on the Emergency Severity Index (ESI). Output your response strictly in JSON format with the following keys:\n""Reasoning"": <the step by step rationale>,\n""Acuity"": <the assigned acuity level as an integer between 1 and 5>,\n', 'user': ""### Instructions\nYour task is to determine the patient's ESI acuity based on the patient's clinical presentation, where ESI 1 indicates the highest priority (requiring immediate, life-saving intervention), and ESI 5 indicates the lowest priority (non-urgent, minimal resources needed). Let's first understand the problem and solve the problem step by step.\n\n** Step 1: Assess Immediate Risk **\n\nIs the patient dying or at immediate risk of death? Consider: Apnea, pulselessness, severe respiratory distress, unresponsiveness, SpO2 < 90%, acute mental status changes.\n\n** Step 2: Determine Need for Immediate Life-Saving Intervention **\n\nDoes the patient require an immediate intervention to secure an airway, support breathing, or maintain circulation? If yes, classify as ESI Level 1. If no, proceed to the next step.\n\n** Step 3: Identify Critical Interventions **\n\nDoes the patient require any of the following life-saving interventions?\n- Airway/Breathing: BVM ventilation, intubation, surgical airway, emergent CPAP/BiPAP.\n- Electrical Therapy: Defibrillation, emergent cardioversion, external pacing.\n- Procedures: Chest needle decompression, pericardiocentesis, open thoracotomy, intraosseous access.\n- Hemodynamics: Major IV fluid resuscitation, blood administration, control of major bleeding.\n- Medications: Naloxone, D50, dopamine, atropine, adenosine.\n\nIf yes, classify as ESI Level 1. If no, proceed to the next step.\n\n** Step 4: Evaluate Key Clinical Signs **\n\nIs the patient presenting with any of these critical conditions?\n- Cardiac Arrest\n- Respiratory Arrest\n- Severe respiratory distress (agonal/gasping respirations)\n- SpO2 < 90%\n- Severe Bradycardia/Tachycardia with hypoperfusion\n- Hypotension with signs of hypoperfusion\n- Critically injured trauma patient (unresponsive)\n- Overdose with a respiratory rate < 6\n- Anaphylactic reaction\n- Infant that is flaccid\n- Unresponsive with a strong odor of alcohol\n- Hypoglycemia with a change in mental status\n\nIf yes, classify as ESI Level 1. If no, proceed to the next step.\n\n** Step 5: Differentiate Between ESI 1 and ESI 2 **\n\n- Does the patient require immediate physician presence for survival? \n- ESI Level 1: Requires physician at bedside immediately. \n- ESI Level 2: Can wait briefly; nurse can initiate care (e.g., IV access, ECG, oxygen).\n\nThree broad questions are used to determine whether the patient meets level-2 criteria. \n1. Is this a high-risk situation? \n    - Vital signs are often not helpful in the identification of high-risk patients. The patient typically presents to the ED with a chief complaint, signs and symptoms, or history suggestive of a problem or condition that is serious and, unless dealt with promptly, can deteriorate rapidly. Often patient age, past medical history, and current medications influence the perceived severity of the chief complaint. \n    - For example, a frail elderly patient with severe abdominal pain is at a much higher risk of morbidity and mortality than a 20-year-old. The elderly patient with abdominal pain should be classified as ESI level 2, while the 20-year-old with stable vital signs will usually be classified as ESI level 3.\n2. Is the patient confused, lethargic or disoriented? \n3. Is the patient in severe pain or distress?\n- All patients who have a pain rating of 7/10 or greater should be considered for meeting ESI level-2 criteria.\n- Considered is a very important word. It is up to the discretion of the triage nurse to determine whether the clinical condition and pain rating in combination warrant a rating of ESI level 2. For example, a patient who had a heavy metal object fall on his toe may rate the pain a 10/10. Indeed, the patient may have a fracture and is experiencing severe pain. The patient probably has done nothing to try to relieve the pain prior to arrival in the ED. The correct triage level for this patient would be ESI level 4. Only one resource will be needed (an x-ray).\n- Examples of patients for whom the triage nurse could use severe pain criteria to justify an ESI level-2 rating include: A patient with 10/10 flank pain who is writhing at triage.\n\n** Step 6: Differentiate between ESI 3, 4 and 5\nResource prediction is an integral part of the ESI for patients identified as ESI level 3, 4, or 5.\n\n** Step 7: If it's not clear by now, analyze the examples provided and identify key similarities and differences between the patient and the examples.\n     \n\n### Patient's Clinical Presentation\nA white, 84-year-old woman arrives at the emergency department via ambulance.
