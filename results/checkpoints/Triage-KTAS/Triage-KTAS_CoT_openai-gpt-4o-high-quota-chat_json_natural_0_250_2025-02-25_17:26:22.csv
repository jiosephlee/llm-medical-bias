Let's understand the KTAS levels and solve this step by step.\n\n** Step 1: Understand KTAS Levels **\nKTAS 1: Immediate aggressive treatment needed for life-threatening conditions. Requires immediate medical examination.\n\nKTAS 2: Potential threats to life, limb or body function requiring quick intervention. Physician's/nurse's reevaluation needed within 15 minutes.\n\nKTAS 3: Conditions that could lead to serious problems potentially requiring emergency intervention. Causes significant discomfort or impacts daily functions. Physician evaluation needed within 30 minutes.\n\nKTAS 4: Condition associated with age-related factors or possibility of pain/complications.
