Her vital signs are within normal limits: temperature 36.4°F, heart rate 60 bpm, respiratory rate 20 breaths/min, systolic blood pressure 100 mmHg, diastolic blood pressure 60 mmHg. She reports a pain level of 4 and is mentally alert. Step 2: Analyze and Compare with Similar Patient Cases - Similar cases include a 24-year-old man with otalgia and a 38-year-old man with ear pain, both assigned an acuity level of 4. These cases had similar presentations with normal vital signs and moderate pain levels. Step 3: Determine the KTAS acuity level - Based on the examples and the KTAS protocol, the patient's condition is non-life-threatening, with stable vital signs and moderate pain. Therefore, the appropriate KTAS acuity level for this patient is 4.",2,Female,47,8,Private Vehicle,No,"otalgia, Lt.",Alert,1,4.0,100.0,60.0,60.0,20.0,36.4,4,Otalgia,4,198
