Step 2: Analyze and Compare with Similar Patient Cases - Most patients with dizziness and stable vital signs are assigned a KTAS level of 3. However, the presence of bradycardia and the specific suspicion of atrial fibrillation/flutter may increase the acuity level. Step 3: Determine the KTAS acuity level - Given the patient's stable condition but the potential seriousness of atrial fibrillation/flutter, a KTAS level of 3 is appropriate, as it indicates a need for urgent evaluation but not immediate life-saving intervention.",2,Male,46,7,Private Ambulance,No,dizziness,Alert,1,4.0,100.0,60.0,52.0,20.0,36.8,2,"Atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter, unspecified",2,9618
,4,"Step 1: Assess the Patient's Risk - The patient is a 47-year-old woman with a chief complaint of left ear pain (otalgia). Her vital signs are stable: temperature 36.4°F, heart rate 60 bpm, respiratory rate 20 breaths/min, systolic blood pressure 100 mmHg, diastolic blood pressure 60 mmHg. She reports a pain level of 4 and is mentally alert. Step 2: Analyze and Compare with Similar Patient Cases - Comparing with similar cases, patients with localized pain and stable vital signs, such as low back pain or leg pain with moderate pain levels, were often assigned acuity levels of 4 or 5. Step 3: Determine the KTAS acuity level - Given the stable vital signs, moderate pain level, and the non-life-threatening nature of otalgia, the patient is likely to require minimal resources and is not in immediate danger. Therefore, the appropriate KTAS acuity level is 4.",2,Female,47,8,Private Vehicle,No,"otalgia, Lt.",Alert,1,4.0,100.0,60.0,60.0,20.0,36.4,4,Otalgia,4,198
